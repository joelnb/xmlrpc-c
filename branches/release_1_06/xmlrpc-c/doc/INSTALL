These are instructions for building Xmlrpc-c from source and installing
it on a system.

See the README file for information on prerequisites (things you need to 
have installed before you can build).


Essentially, it's just the conventional

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

You can also do

  $ make check

to run a battery of tests before you install.  But note that it's as common
for the tests to fail because the tests are broken as because the product
is broken, so consider the results carefully.

To see it work, run a simple server like this:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_server 8080

Then run a client that does an RPC to this server:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_client

(I don't mean to imply that the above are consecutive shell commands;
They can't be, because the server program runs indefinitely).

Also try other sample servers and clients, described in examples/README.


You may want to pass a '--prefix' argument to 'configure'.  See
'./configure --help' for details.

You may also want to disable client XML transports that you won't be
using.  In particular, the Libwww transport can be inconvenient, because
it typically uses about 20 shared libraries.  Any XML-RPC client
program that uses Xmlrpc-c, whether or not the program uses any of the
libwww facilities, must attach all those libraries, and that can take
a significant amount of time.

See './configure --help' for the options that disable certain transports.



WINDOWS

All of the above is essentially for Unix-type operating systems.  To
build and use Xmlrpc-c on Windows, see the file
Windows/ReadMeWin32.txt.
