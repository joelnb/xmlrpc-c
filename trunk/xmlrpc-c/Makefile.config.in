# Makefile.config is generated by 'configure' using Makefile.config.in
# as a template and information that 'configure' gathers from the build
# system and from user options.

# Makefile.config should someday replace most of the other files that
# 'configure' generates, thus simplifying development and customization.
# Makefile.config is intended to contain information specific to the
# particular build environment or user build choices.

# Tokens of the form @TOKEN@ in the template file get replaced by
# 'configure' with the values of variables of the same name within
# 'configure', because of a AC_SUBST(TOKEN) statement in the
# 'configure.in' from which 'configure' was built.


# The following LIBWWW_x make variables have values that ultimately come
# from running the 'libwww-config' program on the build system.  That
# program's job is to tell us how to build a program that uses the libwww
# library.
