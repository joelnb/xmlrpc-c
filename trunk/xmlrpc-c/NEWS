0.9.1 - Eric Kidd <eric.kidd@pobox.com> - 9 January 2000

  * Integrated Rick Blair's fix to speed up libwww client.
  * Added informative URLs to Meerkat example programs.
  * Hid the implementation details of xmlrpc_value, just to keep
    people honest. (No more dangerous allocation on the stack!)
  * Minor C++ code cleanup after buying modern C++ books.
  * Documentation improvements.
