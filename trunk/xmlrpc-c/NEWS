  * Implemented a configurable size limit for XML data off the network.
  * Fixed all recent, reproducible bugs in CVS. These were generally
    Windows build bugs.

  * J. Alan Eldridge, Rosimildo daSIlva: Build fixes.

0.9.6 - Eric Kidd <eric.kidd@pobox.com> - 30 January 2001

  * Fixed lots of gcc warnings.
  * Added a new 'xmlrpc_server_info' class, which allows you to
    set options on a per-server basis.
  * Added support for HTTP Basic authentication.
  * Added internal implementation of system.multicall, lots of brutal test
    cases, and stubs for other system.* commands.
  * Added APIs for accessing CGI and Abyss method registries.
  * Implemented system.listMethods, system.methodHelp, system.methodSignature.
  * Fixed stupid bug in parsing of "(ss*)"-style array descriptions
    where there were no extra elements.
  * Added highly experimental hacked copy of mod_gzip into the
    tools/turbocharger directory. This version supports gzip *and* deflate!
