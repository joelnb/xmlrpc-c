This file contains credits for people who have worked on the XML-RPC C
library. It follows the same format as the Linux kernel credits file, as
described by Linus:

	This is at least a partial credits-file of people that have
	contributed to the linux project.  It is sorted by name, and
	formatted in a format that allows for easy grepping and
	beautification by scripts.  The fields are: name (N), email (E),
	web-address (W), PGP key ID and fingerprint (P), description (D)
	and snail-mail address (S).
