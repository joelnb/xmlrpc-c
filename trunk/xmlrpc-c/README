This is a development release of an XML-RPC library for C and C++
programmers. As such, it still has a few rough edges.

This library has been released under an extremely generous license, but it
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. Please see the file COPYING for the
appropriate terms and disclaimers.

You can find the official xmlrpc-c website at:

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/

To build this library, you'll need to have w3c-libwww 5.2.8 or newer.
Please see the following file:

  GETTING_LIBWWW        How to get a copy of w3c-libwww

Once that's done, you can type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

You may want to pass a '--prefix' argument to configure. See './configure
--help' for details.

To get started, have a look at the following files:

  SECURITY                    Important security information
  doc/overview.txt            Compiling XML-RPC programs; API documentation
  examples/*.c                Sample programs
  src/xmlrpc.h                API documentation
  src/xmlrpc_client.h         API documentation
  src/xmlrpc_abyss.h          API documentation
  src/XmlRpcCpp.h             Experimental C++ API documentation
  src/validatee.c             A more complex XML-RPC server
  doc/gpg-signature-info.txt  Verifying GPG signatures on xmlrpc-c

Also of interest are:

  BUGS                        Known issues
  REFACTORINGS                Suggested code reorganizations
  TESTING                     Notes on testing this library

To run the various server applications, you can type one of the following:

  $ examples/server conf/abyss_root/conf/abyss.conf 
  $ src/servertest conf/abyss_root/conf/abyss.conf 
  $ src/validatee conf/abyss_root/conf/abyss.conf 

To shut down a running server (under Unix), type:

  $ kill `cat conf/abyss_root/log/abyss.pid`

Funding for this project was provided in part by the good folks at First
Peer, Inc., producers of P2P applications.
