We don't handle characters with the high-bit set in a well-defined manner.
Technically, these aren't legal in XML-RPC, but people do use them.
UPDATE: We do the right thing if everybody uses UTF-8 everywhere. But we
should be a bit more formal about it.

We use atoi and atof to parse integers and floats. This is OK for correct
data, but causes us silently convert incorrect data to 0 and 0.0,
respectively.
