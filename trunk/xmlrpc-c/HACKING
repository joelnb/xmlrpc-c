Greetings! So you want to hack on xmlrpc-c, and add some cool new features.
This is good news.

But first, here are some ground rules:

  * For security reasons, only Eric Kidd <eric.kidd@pobox.com> applies
    patches to the CVS HEAD branch. Everybody else sends patches to Eric,
    at least for now. (Frequent contributors will eventually get their own
    branches in CVS, once SourceForge fixes CVS.)

  * When writing new code, please immitate the style of the existing code.
    For the XML-RPC core, this means 8-space tabs, 4-space indentation

  * Patches must be in 'diff -u' format (unified diffs).


Using CVS
---------

Your life will be much easier if you use CVS.  You can find everything you
need at:

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/cvs.php

Once you've checked out a source tree, you can update it by typing:

  $ cvs -z3 update

To create properly formatted diff files, you can type:

  $ cvs -z3 diff -u > my-changes.diff

Mail the resulting file to eric.kidd@pobox.com with a short description.
You can send the file either in the body of the message, or as a plain text
attachment.  Either is fine.

If you want to keep track of updates to the master source tree, you can
subscribe to the xmlrpc-c-cvs mailing list:

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/lists.php


How to Install CVS
