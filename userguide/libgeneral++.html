<TITLE>User manual for XML-RPC For C/C++</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h1>General Library Information - C++</h1>

<p>This chapter contains general information applicable to all of the
C++ programming libraries of XML-RPC For C/C++ (<b>libxmlrpc++</b>,
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b>, etc).

<p>You will also find information of general applicability in
the manual for <a href="libxmlrpc++.html"><b>libxmlrpc++</b></a>, because
it includes basic classes that you use with all the other libraries.

<p>The equivalent chapter for the C libraries is <a
href="libgeneral.html">General Library Information - C</a>.

<p>You must know something about XML-RPC (the protocol) to understand this
chapter.  You don't have to know the details of the protocol, since 
Xmlrpc-c is meant to spare you from learning that, but you do have to know
the kinds of things that make up an XML-RPC transaction.

<p>Almost everything you need to know about XML-RPC is <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">here</a>.  But you will find that the official
specification of the protocol is riddled with ambiguity and other usability
problems.  <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm">This page</a>
adds to it and accurately describes most so-called &quot;XML-RPC&quot;
clients and servers.

<h2 id="namespace">C++ Namespace</h2>

<p>Everything specific to Xmlrpc-c is in the C++ namespace
<b>xmlrpc_c</b>.  For example, the name of the XML-RPC value class is
<b>xmlrpc_c::value</b>.  

<p>There are a few utilities that are packaged with Xmlrpc-c, but
really are not specific to Xmlrpc-c's main purpose (they would be
useful in many other arenas).  These are in other namespaces.  For
example, Xmlrpc-c contains a class for errors.  An object of this
class is not specific to Xmlrpc-c in any way -- any program that
generates errors could use it.  It is in the <b>girerr</b> namespace
(don't ask what the name means &mdash; it's essentially arbitrary).

<h2 id="succfail">Success/Failure</h2>

<p>A method either succeeds or fails.  The distinction might be a
little fuzzy sometimes, but the documentation should make it clear
what is considered successful.

<p>When a method fails, it throws an object.  Pointed-to or referenced
return variables have arbitrary values when the function returns.

<p>A method does not change the state of anything when it fails.  For
all practical purposes, it is the same as if the method had not been
called.

<p>While the object a method throws when it fails does contain
information specifying how it failed, you generally aren't supposed to
call a method just to see how it fails and your program should not
analyze the failure information any further than to discern the type
of object it is.  The failure information within the object is
primarily intended for forwarding to a human to diagnose a larger
problem.  There generally exist interfaces whereby you can learn from
a successful execution whatever you would have learned from some
failed execution.

<p>A method never throws an object (i.e. it always completes and
returns) when it succeeds.

<p>The method an object throws when it fails is usually a
<b>girerr::error</b>, described under <a href="#error">Error
Object</a>.  But if lower level libraries or code you supply throws
something else up to an Xmlrpc-c method, the Xmlrpc-c method often
just throws that on up.

<h2 id="memory">Memory Management</h2>

<p>An Xmlrpc-c method never destroys an object you created, or expects you
to destroy an object it created.  When an Xmlrpc-c method creates an object
and returns it to you, it does so with a shared pointer created by you
such that the object gets deleted automatically after you've destroyed your
pointers.

<p>Likewise, Xmlrpc-c never retains a reference/pointer to an object
you created so that you have to worry about when you can safely
destroy it.  (Of course, when you pass an object as a parameter to a
method, you cannot destroy the object while the method is running).

<h2 id="naming">Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>Names follow the form &quot;paramCount&quot;.  They don't use
underscores to separate words.  Names use underscores in some cases
to reflect inheritance hierarchy, such as in &quot;value_int&quot;
(which is derived from &quot;value&quot;).  And sometimes underscores
reflect other naming hierarchies.

<h2 id="namedarg">C++ Named Arguments</h2>

<p>The Xmlrpc-c libraries use a common C++ use paradigm that allows a
method to have named arguments, which is not possible in C++ itself.
Named arguments means the caller can specify arguments in any order and
omit any of them.  It also means the call is easy to read.  And future
versions of the method can have additional possible arguments without
any loss of backward compatibility.

<p>For our explanation, we will use the following example: The
<B>connectIt</B> method creates an HTTP connection.  You must tell it
either a host name or IP address and optionally TCP port number of the
server and name of the local network interface to use.  The following
are possible calls, all of the same method:

<pre>
<code>
    connectIt(connectOpt()
              .hostname(&quot;www.google.com&quot;)
              .port(8080)
             )

    connectIt(connectOpt()
              .hostaddr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)
              .interface(&quot;eth0&quot;)
             )

    connectIt(connectOpt()
              .interface(&quot;eth0&quot;)
              .hostaddr(&quot;127.0.0.1&quot;)
              .port(8080)
             )

</code>
</pre>

<p>To the unaccustomed, these examples don't even look like legal C++,
but in fact it is quite basic C++.  The periods on the left are just
the &quot;member&quot; operator, as in <b>mystring.length()</b>.  The
code just isn't formatted in the typical way.

<p>Here's how it works: 

<p>The one argument to the constructor is a <b>connectOpt</b> object.
That option contains all of your option specifications.  In the first
example, it knows that you specified a host name and port number (and
the values you specified), but not an IP address or interface name.
<b>connectOpt</b>'s constructor takes no arguments and generates an
object that says you specified no arguments.

<p>A <b>connectOpt</b> has a &quot;setter&quot; method to set each of the
arguments.  So
<code>connectOpt().hostname(&quot;www.google.com&quot;)</code> generates
a <b>connectOpt</b> that says you specified the host name.

<p>But here is the key to the cleverness: The setter method's return
value is a reference to the very object of which it is part.  So you can
use the above expression as the argument to the <b>connectIt</b>
method.  Or you can use it to call another setter method, in a
boundless chain: opt().arg1Setter(arg1).arg2Setter(arg2)...  That's what
you see in the examples above, but formatted for easier reading.

<p>Here are definitions that make the examples work:

<pre>
<code>
    class connectOpt {
    public:
        connectOpt() {
            present.hostname  = false;
            present.hostaddr  = false;
            present.port      = false;
            present.interface = false;
        }

        connectOpt &amp; hostname(string const&amp; arg) {
            present.hostname = true;
            value.hostname   = arg;
        }
        connectOpt &amp; hostaddr(string const&amp; arg) {
            present.hostaddr = true;
            value.hostaddr   = arg;
        }
        connectOpt &amp; port(string const&amp; arg) {
            present.port = true;
            value.port   = arg;
        }
        connectOpt &amp; interface(string const&amp; arg) {
            present.interface = true;
            value.interface   = arg;
        }

        struct {
            string       hostname;
            string       hostaddr;
            unsigned int port;
            string       interface;
        } value;

        struct {
            bool hostname;
            bool hostaddr;
            bool port;
            bool interface;
        } present;
    };
    
    connectIt(connextOpt const&amp; opt);
</code>

<h2 id="threadsafe">Thread Safety</h2>

<p>The libraries, and objects of the classes implemented by them, are
thread-safe.  The libraries do not use static variables.

<p>As an exception, some <b>libxmlrpc_client++</b> objects are not
thread safe.

<p>The libraries' thread safety is of course depends upon thread-safety
of all the libraries it uses.  Your standard C library in particular
must be thread-safe.  As far as I know, all libraries that Xmlrpc-c
uses in typical configurations are thread-safe.

<p>We use the same <a href="libgeneral.html#def_threadsafe">definition
of thread-safety</a> as with the C libraries.
