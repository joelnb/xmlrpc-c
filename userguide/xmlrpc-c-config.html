<h1><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></h1>

<P><B>xmlrpc-c-config</B> is a program that helps you build programs
that use the Xmlrpc-c programming libraries.  It's like -config
programs that go with many Unix programming libraries.

<p>Here's an example of what it does:

<pre>
<tt>
    $ xmlrpc-c-config c++2 client --libs

    -L/usr/local/xmlrpc-c/lib   -lxmlrpc++ -lxmlrpc_client -lxmlrpc
    -lxmlrpc_util -lxmlrpc_xmlparse -lxmlrpc_xmltok -L/usr/local/curl/lib \
    -lcurl -L/usr/local/openssl/lib -lssl -lcrypto -ldl -lz 

</tt>
</pre>

<p>(I split the output into multiple lines for presentation).

<p>The problem <b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> solves is how to know what
libraries to use in compiling and linking a program that uses Xmlrpc-c
libraries.  You don't always know where on the system the library
files (link-time libraries and compile-time header files) are.  But
that's not the worst of it.  The Xmlrpc-c libraries are built to
depend upon other libraries.  If you link your program to an Xmlrpc-c
library, you must also link it to some other library such as the Curl
HTTP library in the example above.

<p>So when you run <b>xmlrpc-c-config</b>, it prints to Standard Output
information about all this.  It's designed to be usable in automated
fashion in a make file.

<p><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> is designed to be in a default executable
search path (typically controlled by the <b>PATH</b> environment
variable), even if no other part of Xmlrpc-c is.  That way, you can
always find it.

<p><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> is customized for a particular system.  When
you build Xmlrpc-c, the builder creates <b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> with
built-in information about how Xmlrpc-c is built and installed on your
system.  You have to supply information such as where you intend to
install it as part of configuring the build.

<p>The command syntax is:

<p><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b>
<i>features</i>
<i>options</i>

<p><i>features</i> is a list of features of the Xmlrpc-c libraries
your program wants to exploit.  The features interact with each other,
so the order is important.  Specifically, <b>c++2</b> and <b>c++</b>
affect the features listed <em>afterward</em>, so if you want C++
versions of all the facilities, be sure to list that feature
<em>first</em>.

<p>The possible values are:

<dl>
<dt><b>c++2</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the regular C++ versions of the libraries.

<dt><b>c++</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the legacy wrapper C++ versions of the
libraries.

<dt><b>client</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the XML-RPC client facilities.

<DT><b>abyss-server</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the Abyss-based XML-RPC server facilities.

<dt><b>cgi-server</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the facilities that help a CGI script
that functions as an XML-RPC server.

<dt><b>pstream-server</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the packet stream server facilities (i.e.
your program is a packet stream pseudo-XML-RPC server).

<dt><b>server-util</b>

<dd>This means you want to use the low-level server utilities such as
registry management.  This is just for programs that use these facilities
explicitly rather than higher level server facilities such as you get
with <b>abyss-server</b>.  You don't need to request this feature to
account for indirect usage of the facilities via other facilities.

</dl>

<P><i>options</i> is a list of tokens describing the information you
want.  The possible values are:

<dl>
<dt><b>--cflags</b>

<dd>Print -I options suitable for compiling a program.

<dt><b>--libs</b>

<dd>Print -L and -l options and library file names, suitable for putting
on a link command.

</dl>

<p>There are also the following special case forms:

<p><b>xmlrpc-c-config --help</b> shows you brief help information.

<p><b>xmlrpc-c-features</b> lists the feature keywords, in case you
forget them.


<p>There are other options, but they haven't been maintained and may not
be useful.  In any case, we don't describe them here.


<p>Warning:  There are lots of different kinds of -config programs in
the world.  Many look similar to this, but have significant
differences.


<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>You can find a good example of how to use <b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> in
the make files in the <b>examples/</b> directory of the Xmlrpc-c
source tree.  The make files there don't use the regular
<b>xmlrpc-c-config</b> because they're supposed to use the Xmlrpc-c
libraries that you have built but not yet installed.  So instead, they
use an alternate version called <b>xmlrpc-c-config.test</b>.  The
comments in the make files tell you how a make file that's not in the
Xmlrpc-c source tree would differ.

<p>Here's a quick example fragment from a GNU Make make file:

<pre>
<code>
INCLUDES = $(shell $(XMLRPC_C_CONFIG) client --cflags)

LIBS = $(shell $(XMLRPC_C_CONFIG) client --libs)

myclient.o:
        cc -c $(INCLUDES) myclient.c

myprog:
        cc -o myclient $(LIBS) myclient.o

</code>
</pre>
