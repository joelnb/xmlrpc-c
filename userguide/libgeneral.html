<BODY>
<h1>General Library Information - C</h1>

<p>This chapter contains general information applicable to all of the
C programming libraries of XML-RPC For C/C++ (<b>libxmlrpc</b>,
<b>libxmlrpc_server</b>, etc).

<p>You will also find information of general applicability in
the manual for <a href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b></a>, because
it includes basic services that you use with all the other libraries.

<p>The equivalent chapter for the C++ libraries is <a
href="libgeneral++.html">General Library Information - C++</a>.

<p>You must know something about XML-RPC (the protocol) to understand this
chapter.  You don't have to know the details of the protocol, since 
Xmlrpc-c is meant to spare you from learning that, but you do have to know
the kinds of things that make up an XML-RPC transaction.

<p>Almost everything you need to know about XML-RPC is <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">here</a>.  But you will find that the official
specification of the protocol is riddled with ambiguity and other usability
problems.  <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/xmlrpc-errata.htm">This page</a>
adds to it and accurately describes most so-called &quot;XML-RPC&quot;
clients and servers.

<h2 id="successfail">Success/Failure</h2>

<p>A library function either succeeds or fails.  The distinction might be
a little fuzzy sometimes, but the documentation should make it clear what
is considered successful.

<p>When a library function fails, it returns no information.  Any
return values or pointed-to return variables have arbitrary values when
the function returns.

<p>A library function does not change the state of anything when it fails.
For all practical purposes, it is the same as if the function had not
been called.

<p>While a library function, when it fails, does return information
specifying how it failed, you generally aren't supposed to call a
function just to see how it fails and your program should not analyze
the failure information.  The failure information is primarily
intended for forwarding to a human to diagnose a larger problem.
There generally exist interfaces whereby you can learn from a successful
execution whatever you would have learned from some failed execution.


<h2 id="globalconst">Global Constants</h2>

<p>There are a variety of constants that the libraries use,
often through their internal use of other libraries, which are too
complicated for the library loader to set up.  Therefore, a program
must call a library function after the program is loaded and running
to finish setting up the library code.  For example, in some
configurations, <b>libxmlrpc_client</b> uses the GNU TLS library
internally to provide SSL connections, and inside that library there
is an elaborate tree that describes the SSL protocol.

<p>Each library that uses such global constants has a global
initialization and global termination function, and any program that
uses the library must call them.  For example,
<b>libxmlrpc_client</b> has <b>xmlrpc_client_setup_global_const()</b>
and <b>xmlrpc_client_teardown_global_const()</b>, and
<b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b> has <b>AbyssInit()</b> and <b>AbyssTerm()</b>.
The global initialization function sets up the global constants.  This
may allocate resources (e.g. the memory for the GNU TLS tree mentioned
above), so the global termination function releases them.

<p>The basic rule for constructing a program that uses one of these
libraries is this: Call the global initialization function immediately
after the program starts, while it is still only one thread and before
it uses the library at all.  Call the global termination function
immediately before the program exits, when the program is again only
one thread and after its last use of the library.

<p>You can call both of these multiple times, as long as all calls
meet these requirements and the number of calls to each is the same.

<p>It isn't actually required that the functions be called at the
beginning and end of the program -- that's just usually the easiest
way to do it.  It <em>is</em> required that the functions be called
when no other thread in the program is running.

<p>These global constant functions are <em>not thread-safe</em>, so you
must not call them when any other thread in the program is running.
It isn't good enough that no other thread be using
<b>libxmlrpc_client</b> at the time, because these functions
internally call similar functions of other libraries, and those
functions are similarly thread-unsafe.  You can't generally know what
these libraries are, or whether other threads are using them.

<p>The global constant situation merits special consideration when the
code you are writing to use the library is not the main program, but
rather a modular piece of a program, e.g. another library.  As a
module, your code doesn't know about other parts of the program -- it
doesn't know whether they use an Xmlrpc-c library or not.  And its
code doesn't necessarily run at the start and end of the whole
program.

<p>A module like this must have global initialization and termination
functions of its own.  The module thus has control at the beginning
and end of the program and has a place to call the Xmlrpc-c global
initialization and termination functions.  Note that if multiple
modules in the program use a particular library, they all will
separately call that library's global initialization and termination
functions, and that's OK because only the first global initialization
and last global termination in a program changes anything (the
libraries use a reference count in static memory).

<p>Some libraries offer simplified interfaces in which the global
initialization and termination are done for you under the covers; but
such an interface has the same restrictions and the global
initialization and termination functions: it isn't thread-safe.

<p>The manual for each Xmlrpc-c library tells you what its global
initialization and termination functions are.

<h2 id="threadsafe">Thread Safety</h2>

<p>The library functions are thread-safe.  They do not use static variables.

<p>Functions that set up and tear down <a href="#globalconst">global
constants</a> are an exception (but not really a significant one, since
it's easy to call those while the program is only one thread).

<p>The <em>objects</em> based on the libraries are generally not thread-safe,
so you must make sure no two threads access a particular object at the same
time.

<p>The <b>xmlrpc_value</b> structure in <b>libxmlrpc</b> and the
<b>xmlrpc_c::value</b> class in <b>libxmlrpc++</b> that is based on it deserve
special mention.  These are thread-safe in Xmlrpc-c 1.33 and later if you use
them properly, but in earlier Xmlrpc-c they are not only thread-unsafe
themselves but make many other objects thread unsafe because these other
objects refer to them.  See <a href="libxmlrpc.html#valueshare">XML-RPC
Values</a> for details.

<p>The objects provided by <b>libxmlrpc_client</b>
and <b>libxmlrpc_client++</b>
are <a href="libxmlrpc_client.html#threadsafe">mostly</a> thread-safe, so you
can have multiple threads using the same transport and talking to the same
server.

<p>The libraries' thread safety depends of course upon thread-safety
of all the libraries it uses.  Your standard C library in particular
must be thread-safe.  As far as I know, all libraries that Xmlrpc-c
uses in typical configurations are thread-safe.

<h3 id="def_threadsafe">Definition of Thread Safety</h3>

<p>A <em>function</em> is &quot;thread-safe&quot; if you can call it from
multiple threads simultaneously without causing something totally
unacceptable like a crash, hang, or memory leak.  A function which was
written without threads in mind -- particularly a function written
before multiple threads were possible -- may very well not meet this
criterion.

<p>A thread-safe function might still cause a disaster when you call
it from multiple threads if it's part of a larger thread-unsafe
procedure.  For example, a function that adds to a linked list is
probably thread-safe.  But if you call it to add to a linked list that
some other thread is presently adding something else to, you have
threading trouble.

<p>An <em>object</em> is thread-safe if you can call its methods
simultaneously from multiple threads without screwing up the object or
causing the totally unaccepted behavior mentioned above.  If a linked
list object is thread-safe, you can call its add method (i.e. its
official designated add function) from multiple threads simultaneously
without corrupting the list.

<p>A library is thread-safe if all its functions and all the object
classes it defines are thread-safe.

<p>That's all thread safety is.  You can use multiple threads without
crashing your program.  But people often expect more from a threaded
program and incorrectly call their expectation &quot;thread
safety.&quot; You may be trying to use threads because you want the
performance benefits of doing two things at once.  But a thread-safe
library won't necessarily give you that.  The easiest way to make a
library thread-safe is to use a big lock to serialize everything --
make sure no two threads are ever executing the meat of the library at
the same time.  You could have 100 threads, and one at a time does
useful work while 99 wait for the library's lock.

<p>So while thread-safety is a good start, you may want to ask about
actual concurrency.


<h2 id="dialect">XML-RPC Dialects</h2>

<p>XML-RPC For C/C++ facilities implement a superset of the XML-RPC
protocol.  I.e. the set of messages and communications you can do with
these facilities is a superset of those specified by XML-RPC.

<p>In the manual, we generally treat the extensions to XML-RPC as if they
are part of XML-RPC, but where it matters, we point out the distinction.

<p>In particular, there are <a
href="libxmlrpc.html#extensiontype">additional data types</a> you can
use for parameter lists and results.

<p>There are two popular versions of the XML-RPC extension data type
nil.  In one, its value is encoded into an XML-RPC message with an XML
element named <tt>nil</tt>.  In the other, the XML element name is
<tt>ex:nil</tt>.  (The &quot;ex&quot; is a namespace and is meant to
make it clear that it is an extension data type).

<p>Similarly, some clients and servers use <tt>i8</tt> for the 64
bit integer type, while others use <tt>ex:i8</tt>.

<p>We refer to these distinct versions of the protocol as dialects.
Xmlrpc-c names the &quot;ex&quot; dialect &quot;Apache&quot;, since it
originated with the <a
href="http://ws.apache.org/xmlrpc/types.html">Apache Java XML-RPC
facility</a>.  It names the other &quot;i8,&quot; for lack of a better
name.

<p>The two dialects are compatible enough that Xmlrpc-c facilities for
<em>interpreting</em> XML-RPC messages can and do handle both all the
time.

<p>But the Xmlrpc-c facilities that <em>generate</em> XML-RPC messages need to
be told which dialect to use, because a partner that handles only one dialect
(e.g. one based on the Apache Java XML-RPC facility) must be sent that
dialect.  So Xmlrpc-c lets you choose on a per-client and per-server basis
which dialect to use.
See <a href="libxmlrpc_client.html#client_create"><b>xmlrpc_client_create()</b></a>
and
<a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#set_dialect"><b>xmlrpc_registry_set_dialect()</b></a>.

<p>If it annoys you that there are two standards for this, which means
you can't make a single Xmlrpc-c-based program that works with all
XML-RPC partners, remember that you really can't use these data types
at all if you want maximum interoperability, because many potential
partners speak only original true XML-RPC.

<p>To refer to a dialect, Xmlrpc-c has the type <b>xmlrpc_dialect</b>.
It is an enumerated type with these values, whose meanings are obvious:

<ul>
<li><B>xmlrpc_dialect_i8</B>
<li><B>xmlrpc_dialect_apache</B>
</ul>


<h2 id="xmlrpccharencoding">XML-RPC Character Encoding</h2>

<p>XML-RPC messages (calls and responses) are XML documents, which use Unicode
characters.  The character encoding of those characters is flexible.

<p>All XML-RPC messages Xmlrpc-c generates use UTF-8 character encoding and
include an XML Processing Instruction (&quot;&lt;?xml ... ?&gt;&quot;) that
says so.

<p>When Xmlrpc-c interprets an XML-RPC message, it understands the following
character encodings and respects the declaration made by an XML Processing
Instruction (&quot;&lt;?xml ... ?&gt;&quot;) of which of these is in use.  If
the encoding specified is anything else, the Xmlrpc-c facility that needs to
interpret the message fails.  If there is no XML Processing
Instruction, Xmlrpc-c assumes UTF-8.

<ul>
<li>ISO 8859-1
<li>US ASCII
<li>UTF-8
<li>UTF-16
<li>UTF-16 Big Endian
<li>UTF-16 Little Endian
</ul>

<p>The above is true if you use the normal built-in version of Expat as its
XML library.  If you use a special build of <b>libxmlrpc</b> that uses
<b>libxml2</b> or any other XML library, the character encoding behavior is
determined by that library.  In no case does <b>libxmlrpc</b> tell the XML
library to use any particular character encoding.


<h2 id="characterencoding">Character Encoding In Programs</h2>

<p>In XML-RPC, strings and structure member names are composed of Unicode
characters; i.e. they can essentially contain any character known to man,
from capital A to o-circumflex to euro sign.

<p>Therefore, many Xmlrpc-c library services take Unicode strings as inputs
and produce Unicode strings as outputs.  (Where possible, though, they always
work in traditional ASCII).

<p>There are various ways of representing a Unicode character in bits.  The
one Xmlrpc-c uses most of the time is UTF-8.  However, there are a few things
you can do in UTF-16 if you prefer.  This manual tells you wherever it refers
to a string what kind of encoding is involved.

<p>If you stick to the subset of Unicode characters that can be represented in
ASCII (plain English text), you don't have to worry about the complexity of
Unicode and UTF-8.  All ASCII text is UTF-8 Unicode text, so you can just use
ASCII, with its simple one byte per character encoding and take it easy.  Note
that ASCII codes are all 7 bits -- the high order bit is zero.  So make sure
your strings never contain a byte with the high order bit set.

<p>If your program contains non-ASCII string literals, you may need to take
special care to understand your editor and compiler and even filesystem to
avoid surprises.  What appears one way on your screen may not be what the
compiler sees when it compiles the code.  On Windows, you can save a character
encoding attribute with a file.  If that attribute of your source file doesn't
match what is actually in that source file, your string literals don't say
what you think they do.
