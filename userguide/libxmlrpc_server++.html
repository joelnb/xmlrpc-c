<h1>libxmlrpc_server++</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> function library, which is part of XML-RPC
For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a href="libgeneral++.html">General
Library Information - C++</a>

<p>You must know something about XML-RPC (the protocol) to understand this
chapter.  You don't have to know the details of the protocol, since 
Xmlrpc-c is meant to spare you from learning that, but you do have to know
the kinds of things that make up an XML-RPC transaction.

<p>Everything you need to know about XML-RPC is <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com">here</a>.

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> library provides C++ classes for use in
a program that is an XML-RPC server.  These classes by themselves
are not enough to implement a server; you need other facilities to 
do the bulk of the work, such as <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b>.
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> contains only facilities that are common to
multiple kinds of server implementations.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server++</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html"><b>libxmlrpc++</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> classes depend on it.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlrpc_server.hpp&gt;</B> header file declares the
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> classes.

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it.  Or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> library is <b>libxmlrpc_server++.a</b> or
<b>libxmlrpc_server++.so</b>.  The classic linker option to cause the
library to be linked into your program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server++</tt>.
These are hints; you'll have to modify this according to conventions
of your particular platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the
library resides and how to make your linker look there for it.

<p>You can use <a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>,
specifying the &quot;c++2&quot; feature and a server type feature, to
find out what libraries to link.  This is designed to be used in a
build program such as a make file.  When properly installed, it tells
exactly how to link on your particular system.

<p>The following libraries are prerequisites of <b>libxmlrpc_server++</b>,
so you'll need to link them in too:

<ul>
<li>libxmlrpc++
<li>libxmlrpc
<li>libxmlrpc_server
<li>libxmlrpc_parse
<li>libxmlrpc_xmltok
<li>libxmlrpc_util
</ul>

And remember that some static linkers care about the order in which
you specify the libraries, with the prerequisite libraries having to
come <em>after</em> the prerequiring library.  <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a> is a good way
to make sure you link all the prerequisites in the right order.


<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>See <a href="index.html#serverexamplepp">Introductory Examples</a>
for a complete example of a simple XML-RPC server written in C++.


<h2 id="method_registry">Method Registry</h2>

<p>An XML-RPC server consists of 1) machinery to receive XML-RPC calls
and send responses to them (called the XML-RPC protocol driver) and 2)
methods.  The protocol driver can be constant for various XML-RPC
server applications.  It's the methods that make a particular XML-RPC
server what it is.  In the small example server mentioned above, which
provides the service of adding two numbers together, the
<b>xmlrpc_c::server_abyss</b> object (courtesy of
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b>) provides the protocol driver, and the
&quot;sample_add&quot; C++ object from the example program is what
makes it an addition server.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_server++</b> provides a facility to connect the XML-RPC
protocol driver with the methods.  It is called the method registry.
It forms a uniform interface that all methods can use to interact with
all protocol drivers.

<p>The essential structure of an Xmlrpc-c server program is like this:
The program defines a C++ class for for each of a bunch of methods and
constructs a single object of each class.  The program creates a
method registry object and adds registers each of its methods in the
registry.  The program then constructs a protocol driver object with
the full registry as a parameter.

<p>The protocol driver object executes an XML-RPC call through the
method registry.  It passes the XML for the XML-RPC call to the method
registry, and the method registry executes the appropriate registered
method and returns the XML for the XML-RPC response to the protocol
driver.

<h3 id="systemmethod">System Methods</h3>

<p>There are some methods, called system methods, that the registry
implements internally (I.e. you don't use
<b>xmlrpc_registry_add_method</b> to add one).  A system method is
concerned with the basic operation of the server rather than whatever
job the particular server does.

<p>The registry implements the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#systemmethod">same system methods</a>
as the C version of the registry.

<p>To disable introspection, call the C++ registry object's
<b>disableIntrospection()</b> method.  Then the server will not have
the Introspection XML-RPC methods.  In a new registry, introspection
is enabled.  There is no way to enable it after disabling it.

<p>To set up <b>system.method</b>, call the C++ registry
object's <a href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#setshutdown">
<b>setShutdown</b> method</a>.


<h3 id="howto">How To Write A Method</h3>

<p>The terminology gets confusing here, because we have both XML-RPC
methods and C++ methods.  You implement an XML-RPC method with a C++
object, and the meat of that object is one of its C++ methods, called
<b>execute</b>.

<p>To write the code for an XML-RPC method, you define a C++ class derived
from Xmlrpc-c's <b>xmlrpc_c::method2</b> class.  Your class must have an
<b>execute</b> method.  That method has the following prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    execute(xmlrpc_c::paramList        paramList,
            const xmlrpc_c::callInfo * callInfoP,
            xmlrpc_c::value *          resultP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>The protocol driver calls your method to perform the guts of an
RPC.  It passes to your method the RPC's parameters as an <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#paramlist"><b>xmlrpc_c::paramList</b> object
</a>.

<p>Your method executes the XML-RPC method and returns the result as
*<i>resultP</i>.

<p>That is all that is required of the class.  

<p>Your constructor may optionally set the object's <b>_signature</b>
member.  This is a <b>std::string</b> that documents the method's use
by the server's XML-RPC Introspection function.  Its value has the
same meaning as the <i>signature</i> argument to <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#xmlrpc_registry_add_method_w_doc">
<b>xmlrpc_registry_add_method_w_doc</b> function</a> in the equivalent
C library.

<p>If your constructor does not set <b>_signature</b>, it is as if you
set its value to &quot;?&quot; (i.e. unspecified).

<p>This signature has nothing to do with what parameters the method actually
requires or how the method code interprets them.  That is determined by the
code in your <b>execute</b> method.

<p>Your constructor may optionally set the object's <b>_help</b>
member.  This is a <b>std::string</b> that describes in human language
how to use the method.  The server's XML-RPC Introspection function
uses this information.

<p>If your constructor does not set <b>_help</b>, the registry uses the
text, &quot;No help is available for this method&quot;.

<p>Beyond that, you can add members and constructors and destructors
to suit your needs.  You can even use class members to keep persistent
state so an RPC can affect future RPCs of the same XML-RPC method.
But that isn't really in the spirit of XML-RPC.  RPCs are supposed to
stand alone.

<p>You will normally have exactly one object of each XML-RPC method
class, and you register that object in the method registry under some
unique method name.

<h4 id="example_method">Example Method Class</h4>

<pre>
<code>
   class sample_add : public xmlrpc_c::method {
   public:
       sample_add() {
           this-&gt;_signature = &quot;i:ii&quot;;
           this-&gt;_help = &quot;This method adds two integers together&quot;;
       }
       void
       execute(xmlrpc_c::param_list       const paramList,
               const xmlrpc_c::callInfo * const callInfoP,
               const xmlrpc_c::value *    const retvalP) {
          
           int const addend(paramList.getInt(0));
           int const adder(paramList.getInt(1));

           *retvalP = xmlrpc_c::value(addend + adder);
      }
   };
</code>
</pre>


<h4 id="failingtherpc">Failing The RPC; Handling Errors</h4>

<p>If your method cannot perform the RPC, it may throw an error.  If
it throws any kind of object, the protocol driver will complete the
RPC as a failed RPC.  But it should preferably throw a
<b>xmlrpc_c::fault</b> or <b>girerr:error</b>.  In the
<b>xmlrpc_c::fault</b> case, the protocol driver returns an XML-RPC
fault response as described by the thrown object.  If it throws a
<b>girerr::error</b>, the protocol driver constructs a fault response
whose fault string is the error description from the
<b>girerr:error</b> object in the XML-RPC response, and whose fault
code is zero.  If <b>execute()</b> throws anything else, the protocol
driver makes up a fault response that describes an internal server
error.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    enum faultCodes { CODE_OVERFLOW=3 };

    void
    execute(xmlrpc_c::param_list       const paramList,
            const xmlrpc_c::callInfo * const callInfoP,
            const xmlrpc_c::value *    const retvalP) {
       
        int const addend(paramList.getInt(0));
        int const adder(paramList.getInt(1));

        if (addend > 0 &amp;&amp; adder > 0 &amp; addend + adder &lt; 0)
            throw(xmlrpc_c::fault(&quot;Sum is too large.&quot;,
                                  CODE_OVERFLOW);

        *retvalP = xmlrpc_c::value(addend + adder);
    
</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="using_method">Using A Method Class</h4>

<p>A <b>xmlrpc_c::method2</b> is an <a href="libxmlrpc++.html#autoObject">
auto-object</a>.  Class <b>xmlrpc_c::methodPtr</b> is its pointer class.
You ordinarily refer to your method object by such a pointer.  In fact,
it is the only way to register your method object with the method
registry.

<p>So create the object following this example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::methodPtr const sampleAddMethodP(new sample_add);
</code>
</pre>

<p>You will never delete this object; it gets deleted automatically when
the last reference goes away.


<h4 id="callinfo">callInfo object</h4>

<p>As you see, one of the arguments to your <B>execute</B> method is a pointer
to a <b>xmlrpc_c::callInfo</b> object.  It gives you information about how the
XML-RPC call arrived.  You can usually ignore this as in the example above.
The most common thing people use it for is to find out the IP address of
the caller.

<p><b>xmlrpc_c::callInfo</b> is an abstract base class.  What <i>callInfo</i>
really points to is some derived class of it that is particular to the kind of
server in question.  For example, if it is an Abyss-based XML-RPC server (via
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b>), then <i>callInfoP</i> points to an object of
that library's
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss++.html#class_callinfo_serverAbyss"></a>
<b>xmlrpc_c::callInfo_serverAbyss</b> class.

<h4 id="methodclassic">old <b>method</b> class</h4>

<p><b>xmlrpc_c::method2</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.19 (June 2009).  Before
that, you have to use <b>xmlrpc_c::method</b> instead (and it continues to
work fine with current Xmlrpc-c).  It's the same except that its
<b>execute</b> method does not have the <i>callInfoP</i> argument.  The
information available via <i>callInfoP</i> is not available in any way with
<b>method</b>.


<h3 id="defaultmethod">The Default Method Object</h3>


<p>When the client specifies a method name that is not in the method
registry, the protocol driver calls the <b>execute</b> method of the
&quot;default method object&quot; that you registered.  A registry
contains zero or one default method object.

<p>You can use this to bypass much of the work that the registry does
and do your own dispatching of methods: just don't register any
methods, and all XML-RPC calls will result in a call to your default
method object.  But if you're going to do that, it would probably be
cleaner just to derive your own method registry class from
<b>xmlrpc_c::registry</b> and write your code as that class' methods.

<p>If you don't register a default method object and an XML-RPC call
specifies a method name that is not in the registry, the registry
services automatically return a &quot;no such method&quot; fault
response.

<p>A default method object, which is of Class
<b>xmlrpc_c::defaultMethod</b>, is just like a regular method object
except that its <b>execute</b> method has two more parameters:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    execute(std::string         methodName,
            xmlrpc_c::paramList paramList,
            xmlrpc_c::value *   resultP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>methodName</i>) tells you the method name that the client
specified.

<p>There is a class <b>xmlrpc_c::defaultMethodPtr</b> which is analogous to
<b>xmlrpc::methodPtr</b>.



<h3 id="registry_object">The Registry Object</h3>

<p>The method registry is an object of Class <b>xmrpc_c::registry</b>.

<p>You construct a registry object and provide it to your server.

<p>A <b>xmlrpc_c::registry</b> is an <a href="libxmlrpc++.html#autoObject">
auto-object</a>.  Class <b>xmlrpc_c::registryPtr</b> is its pointer class.
The most convenient way to refer to a registry is by such a pointer, unless
you can use an automatic (i.e. stack) variable.

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.05 (March 2006), <b>xmlrpc_c::registry</b> is not
derived from <b>xmlrpc_c::registry</b>.  You must use C++ pointers and
explicitly ensure that the registry object continues to exist as long
as it is being used.

<h4 id="constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>The only constructor is the no-argument constructor.  This creates
a registry with no methods other than system methods; not even a
default method.  You build it up from there by calling other methods.

<h4 id="addmethod"><b>addMethod</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method adds an XML-RPC method to the registry.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    xmlrpc_c::methodPtr sampleAddMethodP(new sampleAddMethod);
    myRegistry.addMethod(&quot;sample.add&quot;, sampleAddMethodP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    addMethod(string              const name,
              xmlrpc_c::methodPtr const methodP);
</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="setdefaultmethod"><b>setDefaultMethod</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method sets the registry's default method, as decribed in
<a href="#defaultmethod">The Default Method Object</a>.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    xmlrpc_c::defaultMethodPtr myDefaultMethodP(new myDefaultMethod);
    myRegistry.setDefaultMethod(myDefaultMethodP);
</code>
</pre>


<h4 id="disableintrospection"><b>disableIntrospection</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method deletes the built-in <a
href="#systemmethod">introspection methods</a> from the registry.
These methods exist in a newly created registry until you delete them.
There's no way to add them back.  This method is meant to be used as
an extension of the registry class' constructor.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    disableIntrospection();
</code>
</pre>


<h4 id="setdialect"><b>setDialect</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method modifies the registry to set the <a
href="libxmlrpc.html#dialect">dialect</a> for responses.

<p>Examples:
<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry registry;
    registry.setDialect(xmlrpc_dialect_apache);
</code>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry registry;
    registry.setDialect(xmlrpc_dialect_i8);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    setDialect(xmlrpc_dialect dialect);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>dialect</i> is the dialect you're setting.

<p>By default (if you have never set the dialect), when an XML-RPC
server executes an XML-RPC method via the registry, the response goes
in the i8 dialect.

<p>This method was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.11 (June 2007).


<h4 id="setshutdown"><b>setShutdown</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method modifies the registry to indicate a way to implement
the <b>system.shutdown</b> <a href="#systemmethod">system method</a>.
Until you execute this method, <b>system.shutdown</b> fails.

<p>Examples:
<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;

    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss myServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                   .registryP(&amp;myRegistry)
                                   .portNumber(8080)
                                   );

    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::shutdown shutdown(&amp;myServer);

    registry.setShutdown(&amp;shutdown);
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry registry;
    
    class myshutdown : public xmlrpc_c::registry::shutdown {
    public:
        myshutdown(myServerType * const serverHandle) :
            serverHandle(serverHandle) {}

        void doit(string const&amp; comment,
                  void * const) const {

            cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;Shutting down because &quot; &lt;&lt; comment &lt;&lt;endl;
            shutdownMyServer(serverHandle);
        }
    
    private:
        myServerType * const serverHandle;
    };

    myshutdown shutdown(&amp;myServer);

    registry.setShutdown(&amp;shutdown);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    setShutdown(registry::shutdown * const shutdownP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>shutdownP</i> is a pointer to an object that knows how to shut down
the server that is using this registry.

<p>The <b>registry::shutdown</b> class exists just to be an argument
to this method.  It is an abstract base class with one method:
<b>doit</b>.  <B>doit</B> shuts down the server.

<p>This is the prototype of <b>doit</b>:

<pre>
<code>
    void doit(string const&amp; comment,
              void * const  callInfo) const;
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>comment</i> is a comment describing the shutdown (to wit, the
parameter of the <b>system.shutdown</b> method -- information from the
XML-RPC client).

<p><i>callInfo</i> is non-XML-RPC transport information about the
XML-RPC call that requested the shutdown.  A typical purpose of this
would be to tell the IP address of the requester, so <b>doit</b> can
determine whether the requester has permission to shut down the
server.

<p>However, <i>callInfo</i> is not implemented today.  Its value is
meaningless.

<p>Because it is an abstract base class, you must pass an object of a
class <em>derived</em> from it to <b>setShutdown</b>.  This derived
class is specific to the kind of server that is to use the registry,
because its <b>doit</b> method must know how to shut down the server.


<p>This method was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.13 (December 2007).  Before that,
you cannot use <b>system.shutdown</b> to shut down a server.


<h3 id="executing">Executing an XML-RPC Method</h3>

<p>This section describes the client-facing interface to the method
registry.  This is the interface that an XML-RPC protocol driver uses
to talk to the registry.

<p>The <b>processCall()</b> method executes an XML-RPC call, given in
XML form, and returns the response, again in XML form.  This entails
looking up the named method in the registry and calling the
<b>execute</b> method of the XML-RPC method C++ object associated with
it.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    processCall(std::string   callXml,
                std::string * responseXmlP) const;

</code>
</pre>

<p>For most errors, including if the XML-RPC method object's
<b>execute</b> method throws anything at all, <b>processCall</b>
returns an XML-RPC fault response as *<i>responseP</i>.  But it is
possible for some kinds of error in the server program to cause
<b>processCall</b> to throw a <b>girerr::error</b>.

<p><i>callXml</i> is the complete XML of the XML-RPC call.  It isn't
necessarily valid.

<p>The method returns as *<i>responseXmlP</i> a string whose value is
the complete XML of the XML-RPC response to the XML-RPC call.  The
registry ensures that this is a valid XML-RPC response, regardless of
what the method function does.  Caller is responsible for deleting the
string.

<p>To make this function trace the XML input and output, see the <a
href="#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a> environment variable.


<h3 id="faults">Faults</h3>

<p>Method registry facilities that execute an RPC may generate a fault
response for the RPC.  Sometimes the details of that fault are supplied
by the registered method object; sometimes they come from Xmlrpc-c
directly.

<p>Where Xmlrpc-c generates a fault directly, the fault code is one of the
ones enumerated for the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#class_fault"><b>xmlrpc_c::fault</b></a> class.  Where
Xmlrpc-c takes fault information from the registered method object, the fault
code is entirely up to that object.  Note that this means Xmlrpc-c does not
conform to the <a
href="http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/specs/rfc.fault_codes.php">Fault Code
Interoperability standard</a>.

<h3 id="debugging">Debugging</h3>

<p>This section describes some facilities and techniques for debugging
programs that use <b>libxmlrpc_server</b>.

<h4 id="trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML environment variable</h4>

<p>If you set the <b>XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</b> environment variable to
<b>1</b>, the <b>libxmlrpc_server</b> registry functions print to
Standard Error the XML of the call and of the response, in addition to
their normal processing.

<p>It works the same as for the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#trace_xml">C server library</a>.
