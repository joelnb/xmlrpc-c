<p><b>xmlrpc_dumpserver</b> is a diagnostic XML-RPC server program.  It
executes any RPC it receives by printing to Standard Output its parameters.


<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<pre>
<tt>
     $ xmlrpc_dumpserver -port=8080
</tt>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p><b>xmlrpc_dumpserver</b> runs an XML-RPC server that executes any RPC
it receives by printing to Standard Output the fact that the call was made
and its parameters.

<p>The server executes any method (i.e. a call with any method name) the
same as any other.

<p>The RPC always fails, with a message explaining that it is a test server.

<p>You can use this to test an XML-RPC client -- to see what it is really
sending as a call and give it a valid response to process.

<p>To get more detail about the call, use the
<a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#trace_xml"> <b>XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</b>
environment variable</a>.

<p>The server executes the built-in (&quot;system.*&quot;) methods
normally.  <b>system.shutdown</b> works.

<p>If you direct Standard Output to a file, you'll need to shut down the
server cleanly in order to flush the operating system output buffer to the
file.  You can do that by performing a <b>system.shutdown</b> RPC.
