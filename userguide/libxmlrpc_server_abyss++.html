<h1>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> function library, which is part of
XML-RPC For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a
href="libgeneral++.html">General Library Information - C++</a>

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> library provides C++ classes
for use in a program that is an XML-RPC server based on the Abyss HTTP
server.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html"><b>libxmlrpc++</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> classes depend on it.

<p>Similarly, you will need the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html">libxmlrpc_server++</a> library.  It
contains C++ classes for XML-RPC servers that are not specific to
Abyss-based servers.  And <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> classes
depend on it.

<p>Finally, you will need Abyss itself, which is in the library
<b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b>, which is part of Xmlrpc-c.  Note that there
is no C++ version of Abyss.  <B>libxmlrpc_abyss</B> is straight C.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlrpc_server_abyss.hpp</B> header file declares the
interface to <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>.

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it.  Or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> library is
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++.so</b>.
The classic linker option to cause the library to be linked into your
program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server_abyss++</tt>.  These are hints; you'll
have to modify this according to conventions of your particular
platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the library resides
and how to make your linker look there for it.


<p>Because the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#linking"><b>libxmlrpc++</b></a>, <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html"><b>libxmlrpc_server++</b></a>, and <a
href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html"><b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b></a> libraries are
prerequisites, you'll also need to link those, and their prerequisite
libraries, into your XML-RPC server program.

<p>You can use <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>, specifying the
&quot;c++2&quot; and &quot;abyss-server&quot; features, to find out
what libraries to link.  This is designed to be used in a build
program such as a make file.  When properly installed, it tells
exactly how to link on your particular system.


<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>See <a href="index.html#serverexamplepp">Introductory Examples</a>
for a complete example of a simple XML-RPC server based on Abyss
written in C++.

<h2 id="about_abyss">About Abyss</h2>

<p>See <a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#aboutabyss">C library
abyss server documentation</a> for general information about Abyss and
the various options you have for building an XML-RPC server based on
it.  Xmlrpc-c provides a C++ version of only the highest level of
those methods: A C++ alternative to <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>.


<h2 id="facilities">Description Of Facilities</h2>

<h3 id="class_serverAbyss">class <b>serverAbyss</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss</b> is an XML-RPC server
based on the Abyss HTTP server.

<p>The server responds to XML-RPC calls addressed to a particular
URI path (usually &quot;/RPC2&quot;, but you choose when you create the
object).

<p>You supply the XML-RPC methods for the server to execute as an <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#method_registry">Xmlrpc-c method
registry</a>.

<p>There are essentially three ways to use a <b>serverAbyss</b>
object:

<UL>
<li>You supply a TCP port number; the server listens for connections
from XML-RPC clients to that port number.
<li>You supply a TCP socket, already bound to the port number you want;
the server listens for connections from XML-RPC clients on that socket.
<li>You supply already connected sockets, one at a time.  The server
processes an RPC on each socket you provide.
</UL>

<p>You choose between these models by your choice to specify the
<b>portNumber</b>, <b>socketFd</b>, or neither option to the
constructor.

<p>The simplest thing is to use <b>portNumber</b> and let
<b>serverAbyss</b> do all the work.  But it's often good design to
leave binding of a socket to a separate program.  For one thing, it's
an operation common to all TCP servers, and it's nice to avoid
duplicating it in your XML-RPC server program.  Also, it's better for
security: The binding program can have privileges needed to bind a
reserved port number, while the XML-RPC server program does not.

<p>Using individual connected sockets (don't specify either
<b>portNumber</b> or <b>socketFd</b>) works for an inetd-based server
and is also useful if you have some other sophisticated connection
management system.

<h4 id="serverAbyss_example">Example</h4>

<p>See <a href="index.html#serverexamplepp">Introductory Examples</a>
for a complete example of a simple XML-RPC server that uses
<b>xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss</b>.


<h4 id="serverAbyss_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>Overview:

<pre>
<code>
serverAbyss::serverAbyss(constrOpt const&amp; opt);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Examples:

<p>Listens for and processes RPCs on Port 8080:
<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss abyssServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                      .registryP(&amp;myRegistry)
                                      .portNumber(8080)
                                      .logFileName("/tmp/xmlrpc_log")
                                     );
</code>
</pre>

<p>Same, using an automatic pointer to manage registry lifetime:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registryPtr myRegistryP(new xmlrpc_c::registry);
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss abyssServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                      .registryPtr(myRegistryP)
                                      .portNumber(8080)
                                     );
</code>
</pre>

<p>You bind the socket yourself, then server accepts connections on it:

<pre>
<code>
    ...
    int fd;
    fd = socket(...);
    ...
    bind(fd, ...);
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss abyssServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                      .registryPtr(myRegistryP)
                                      .socketFd(fd)
        );
</code>
</pre>

<p>You pass connections to the server one at a time, like inetd:

<pre>
<code>
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss abyssServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                      .registryPtr(myRegistryP)
                                     );
</code>
</pre>

<p>This constructor uses the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#constropt"><i>constrOpt</i> paradigm</a> to
make specifying options easy and flexible, though technically there is
just one C++ parameter.

<p>The option methods are:

<dl>

<dt>registryPtr(xmlrpc_c::registryPtr)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
The pointer takes care of managing the existence of the registry;
you can destroy all your pointers to the registry after the constructor
returns.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>registryP(const xmlrpc_c::registry *)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
You must ensure that the registry to which it points continues to exist
as long as the server (xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss object) does.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>socketFd(xmlrpc_socket)

<dd>This identifies a TCP socket that is bound to the desired network
address, ready to be listened on.  It is analogous to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#socket_fd"><b>socket_fd</b></a> parameter with the following exceptions.

<p>You cannot specify <b>sockaddrP</b> or <b>portNumber</b> if you
specify <b>socketFd</b>.

<p>If you specify neither <b>socketFd</b> nor <b>sockAddrP</b>
nor <b>portNumber</b>, instead of a server that listens on IP Version 4 Port
8080, you get a server that does not listen at all.  It does not accept
connections.  Your program must feed complete connections to the server one at
a time.

<dt>portNumber(unsigned int)

<dd>This gives the TCP port number on which the server is to listen for
connections from XML-RPC clients.  It is analogous to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#port_number"><b>port_number</b></a>
parameter with the following exceptions.

<p>If you specify neither <b>socketFd</b> nor <b>sockAddrP</b>
nor <b>portNumber</b>, instead of a server that listens on IP Version 4 Port
8080, you get a server that does not listen at all.  It does not accept
connections.  Your program must feed complete connections to the server one at
a time.

<dt>sockAddrP(const struct sockaddr *)

<dd>This points to a conventional POSIX socket address that tells the network
address and port where the server will listen for connections from XML-RPC
clients.  It is analogous to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#sockaddr_p"><b>sockaddr_p</b></a>
parameter with the following exceptions.

<p>If you specify neither <b>socketFd</b> nor <b>sockAddrP</b>
nor <b>portNumber</b>, instead of a server that listens on IP Version 4 Port
8080, you get a server that does not listen at all.  It does not accept
connections.  Your program must feed complete connections to the server one at
a time.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.30 (March 2012).

<dt>sockAddrLen(socklen_t)

<dd>This goes with <b>sockAddrP</b>. 

It is analogous to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> 
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#sockaddrlen"><b>sockaddrlen</b></a>
parameter.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.30 (March 2012).

<dt>uriPath(std::string)<dd>

<p>This names the URI path of the XML-RPC server.  For example, if a
client will make an XML-RPC call using the URL
&quot;http://www.google.com/RPC2&quot;, the URI path is &quot;/RPC2&quot;.
The Abyss server will process as an XML-RPC call anything POSTed to
that URI path and reject requests to any other URI path.

<p>The default is &quot;/RPC2&quot;.

<p>For more information on what a URI path is, see
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#set_handlers2">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b></a>.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.06 (June 2006).  Before that, the
URI path is always &quot;/RPC2&quot;.

<dt>logFileName(std::string)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#log_file_name"><B>log_file_name</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>maxConn(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#max_conn"><B>max_conn</b>
parameter</a>.  It was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.31 (September 2012).

<dt>maxConnBacklog(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#max_conn_backlog"><B>max_conn_backlog</b>
parameter</a>.  It was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.31 (September 2012).

<dt>maxRpcMem(size_t)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#max_rpc_size"><B>max_rpc_size</b>
parameter</a>.  It was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.44 (December 2015).

<dt>keepaliveTimeout(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#keepalive_timeout"><B>keepalive_timeout</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>keepaliveMaxConn(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#keepalive_maxconn"><B>keepalive_maxconn</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>timeout(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#timeout"><B>timeout</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>dontAdvertise(bool)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#dont_advertise"><B>dontadvertise</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>serverOwnsSignals(bool)

<dd>This says the server object owns all the signals in the process.
It can install signal handlers.  If other parts of your program need
to use signals, see the section <a href="#signals"><i>signals</i></a>.

<p>Default is true.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.19 (June 2009).

<dt>expectSigchld(bool)

<dd>This says you will call the object's <b>sigchld</b> method every time
the program receives a SIGCHLD signal.

<p>This is meaningful only when
<b>serverOwnsSignals</b> is false (otherwise, you don't know anything about
signals).  Assuming it is, you ordinarily want to call <b>sigchld</b> like
this and specify <b>expectSigchld(true)</b> to let the object know you will.
See the section <a href="#signals"><i>signals</i></a>.

<p>Default is false.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.19 (June 2009).

<dt>chunkResponse(bool)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#chunk_response"><B>chunk_response</b>
parameter</a>.

<dt>allowOrigin(string)

<dd>This is analogous to to the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#allow_origin"><B>allow_origin</b>
parameter</a>, but doesn't have any analog to the null value.  (If you
don't want to participate in HTTP access control, just omit this option).

<dt>accessControlMaxAge(unsigned int)

<dd>This is analogous to to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> <a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#access_control_max_age"><B>access_control_max_age</b>
parameter</a>, but also fills the role of <b>access_control_expires</b>: If
you specify this option, access control expires.  If you don't it doesn't.

</dl>


<p>Here's an older, more primitive constructor:

<pre>
<code>
    serverAbyss(
        xmlrpc_c::registry const&amp; registry,
        unsigned int       const  portNumber = 8080,
        std::string        const&amp; logFileName = &quot;&quot;,
        unsigned int       const  keepaliveTimeout = 0,
        unsigned int       const  keepaliveMaxConn = 0,
        unsigned int       const  timeout = 0,
        bool               const  dontAdvertise = false,
        bool               const  socketBound = false,
        xmlrpc_socket      const  socketFd = 0
        );
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>registry</i> defines the methods that the server will execute.
See <a href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#registry_object">The Registry
Object</a>.

<p>The rest of the parameters have the same meaning as those of the
same name used with the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#server_abyss_parameters">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> C interface</a>.

<p>The <i>registry</i> argument is somewhat unconventional and tricky
to use, because of a design mistake.  While you don't pass a pointer, the
<b>serverAbyss</b> object remembers its address and refers to it
throughout its life.  So you must ensure that your registry continues
to exist as long as the <b>serverAbyss</b> object does.  You should
really just use the newer <b>constrOpt</b>-based constructor instead.

<p>The server object so created listens on the relevant socket for
connections.  The operating system will accept and queue some
connections.  But the object does not take and process any.  For that,
you need to call a method such as <b>run</b>.

<h4 id="run"><b>run</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method runs the server.

<b>run</b> runs the functions of the server: It accepts connections as
they arrive and executes the RPCs that come over the connections.  It
executes RPCs in parallel, not serially; i.e. if RPC 2 arrives when
the server is still executing the prior RPC 1, the server begins executing
RPC 2 immediately; it does not wait to finish RPC 1.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss myAbyssServer(
        xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
        .portNumber(8080)
        ...);

    myAbyssServer.run();
</code>
</pre>


<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    run();
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you need the server to execute RPCs serially, see <a
href="#runonce"><b>runOnce</b></a>.

<p><b>run</b> returns when the server shuts down, which happens when
you call its <a href="#terminate"><b>terminate</b></a> method or the
server executes a <a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#system.shutdown">
<b>system.shutdown</b></a> <a href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#systemmethod">
system method</a> (provided you have set up an appropriate
<a href="#shutdown"><b>shutdown</b></a> object).

<p>As an alternative, you can use <b>runOnce</b> in a loop and use
various methods to break the loop when you want the server to end.

<p><b>run</b> may throw an error if it is or becomes impossible to run
the server.

<P>By default, <b>run</b> expects to own all the <a
href="#signals">signals</a> in the process.  This is of course very
un-object-like behavior.  If you set up signal handling yourself, see
the discussion of <a href="#signals">signals</a>.


<h4 id="runonce"><b>runOnce</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to process one RPC
(waiting for one if necessary).  It waits for the next
HTTP connection on the server's listening socket, accepts it, reads the
HTTP POST request, executes the indicated RPC, and closes the
connection.  Note that because the listening socket is perpetually
listening, the operating system will accept and queue connections on its
own.  <b>runOnce()</b> processes a previously accepted connection.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss myAbyssServer(
        xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
        .portNumber(8080)
        ...);

    myAbyssServer.runOnce();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    runOnce();
</code>
</pre>

<p><b>runOnce</b> is a good way to make sure your server executes no
more than one RPC at a time, when your method function is written to
be single threaded.  It is also a good way to ensure that all RPCs
execute against the same memory, as opposed to running in separate
processes.  And it's the easiest to debug.  All new server programs
should start out using this interface, before graduating to the more
demanding <b>run</b> approach.

<p><b>runOnce</b> aborts waiting for a connection request and
returns immediately if the process receives a signal.  Note that
unless you have a handler for that signal, the signal will probably
kill the whole process, so set up a signal handler &mdash; even one that
does nothing &mdash; if you want to exploit this.  But before Xmlrpc-c 1.06
(June 2006), signals have no effect &mdash; there is no way to make
<b>runOnce</b> abort the wait and return.

<p><b>runOnce</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.05 (March 2006).


<h4 id="runconn"><b>runConn</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to process one HTTP request
from the read/write Abyss socket you supply.  For normal HTTP, the
socket must be for a new TCP connection, with nothing having been read
or written on the connection yet.  <b>runConn()</b> reads an HTTP
request from the socket, performs it, and writes the response to the
socket.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss myAbyssServer(
         xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
         .registryP(&amp;myRegistry));

    myAbyssServer.runConn(STDIN_FILENO);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    runConn(int socketFd);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>socketFd</i> is a file descriptor (such as you get from a standard C
library <b>open</b> call) of the aforementioned socket.  It should be a
stream socket in connected state.

<p>This would be useful for an Inetd application.  Inetd is a server
common on Unix systems that listens for connections on various ports
simultaneously.  When it gets one, it accepts it and forks a process
and execs a program that provides whatever service is supposed to be
available on the port in question.  For example, Inetd might be
configured to accept connections to the FTP port, among others.  When
someone tries to connect to the FTP port, Inetd accepts the connection
and forks a process running an FTP server program.  It continues
listening for further FTP connections and forks other FTP server
processes to handle any others.

<p>Inetd passes the connected stream socket to the processor program
as its Standard Input.  The processor program must be designed to
expect a connected stream socket on its Standard Input.  One way to
construct such a program is to have it call the <b>runConn</b> method
with the file descriptor number of Standard Input (0) as its argument.

<p><b>runConn</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.05 (March 2006).


<h4 id="sigchld"><b>sigchld</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method informs the server object that the process has received
a SIGCHLD signal, possibly for a child process it created.  You don't use
this unless you explicitly created the server object to require it.

<p>See section <a href="#signals"><i>signals</i></a> for information on
how and why to use this.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    static void 
    sigchld(int const signalClass) {
    /*----------------------------------------------
       This is a signal handler for a SIGCHLD signal
    ----------------------------------------------*/
        // Reap zombie children / report to Abyss until there aren't any more.
    
        bool zombiesExist;
        bool error;
    
        assert(signalClass == SIGCHLD);
        
        zombiesExist = true;  // initial assumption
        error = false;  // no error yet
        while (zombiesExist &amp;&amp; !error) {

<h4 id="terminate"><b>terminate</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes an Abyss XML-RPC server that is running to
terminate, and to terminate immediately if it starts running in the
future.

<p>Because a program that starts a server running does not regain
control as long as the server is running, this is meant to be called
from a separate thread or signal handler.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    myServerP-&gt;terminate();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void terminate();
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you have a signal handler that calls <b>terminate()</b> and the
process receives a signal while the server is running, the server will
terminate (<b>run()</b> will return) soon after the signal handler
returns.  If the server is processing an RPC when the
process receives the signal, it will not terminate until it is done with that
RPC.

<p>You can also call this from an XML-RPC method (i.e. from the
<b>execute</b> method of a <b>xmlrpc_c::method</b> object), as long as
that object is in the same process that waits for and accepts new
connections.  If, on the other hand, you are running the server with
<b>run()</b> and you have a system in which it does that by way of a
Unix fork, a <b>terminate()</b> from inside an Abyss HTTP request
handler has no effect.

<p>If you are running the server with <b>run()</b>, which means the
server processes the connections (executes RPCs) in separate threads,
<b>terminate()</b> affects only the foreground thread that waits
for, accepts, and dispatches new connections.  The background RPC
threads continue normally to completion in their own time.

<p>This method was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.11 (June 2007).  Before that,
there is no way to terminate a running <b>xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss</b>
server.

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008), <b>terminate</b> can't actually
interrupt anything the server is doing -- the server won't notice it is
supposed to terminate as long as it is asleep waiting for an RPC.  So the
server terminates after the next RPC.

<p>The same is true on Windows until Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010) &mdash;
<b>terminate</b> can't interrupt anything.


<h4 id="shutdown"><b>shutdown</b> Subclass</h4>

<p>This class is for enabling the <b>system.shutdown</b>
<a href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#systemmethod">system method</a>.

<p>It is a derived class of <b>xmlrpc_c::registry::shutdown</b>, so you can
pass an object of this class to
the <a href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#setshutdown">
<b>xmlrpc_c::registry::setShutdown</b></a> of your method registry before
running the Abyss server.  If you do, when the server executes
the <b>system.shutdown</b> method, it has the effect of calling the
server's <a href="#terminate"><b>terminate</b></a> method.


<p>Example:
<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;

    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss myServer(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::constrOpt()
                                   .registryP(&amp;myRegistry)
                                   .portNumber(8080)
                                   );

    xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss::shutdown shutdown(&amp;myServer);

    registry.setShutdown(&amp;shutdown);
</code>
</pre>

<p>The only method you will call is the constructor:

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    shutdown(xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss * const serverP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>serverP</i> identifies the server that you want the object to
terminate.  It doesn't make sense to specify any server other than the
one that you set up to use this registry.

<p>This class was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.13 (December 2007).  Before that,
there is no way for <b>system.shutdown</b> to shut down a
<b>serverAbyss</b> server.

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008) on Unix, and on Windows before Xmlrpc-c
1.25 (December 2010), <b>system.shutdown</b> can't actually interrupt anything
the server is doing &mdash; the server won't notice it is supposed to
terminate as long as it is asleep waiting for an RPC.  So you normally have to
call it twice -- once to request shutdown, and once to wake up the master
thread so it notices the request.  But if you're running the server in a
single-thread manner, you don't have this problem because the server will
notice the termination after the <b>system.shutdown</b> completes and before
it waits for the next RPC.

<h4 id="getListenName"><b>getListenName</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method queries the socket address on which the server is listening.
The socket address is an IP address and TCP port number, except that it can
instead of IP address, it can indicate &quot;any address to which this
computer answers&quot;).

<p>This isn't normally useful because when you created the server, you told it
to listen on a particular port.  But it is also possible to tell the server to
choose a free port on its own, and if you did that, you could use this method
to find out what port it chose so you could tell clients.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    struct sockaddr * listenNameP;
    sockaddr_len listenNameLen;

    getListenName(&amp;listenNameP, &amp;listenNameLen);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    getListenName(struct sockaddr ** sockaddrPP,
                  size_t *           sockaddrLenP);
</code>
</pre>


<p>This method was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.46 (March 2016).

<h3 id="class_callinfo_serverAbyss">Class <b>callinfo_serverAbyss</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>callinfo_serverAbyss</b> is something that gets
passed to your XML-RPC method (i.e. to the <b>execute</b> method of a
<b>xmlrpc_c::method</b> object) to give it information about how the XML-RPC
call arrived.  It is an instance of <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#callinfo"><b>xmlrpc_c::callInfo</b></a> specific
to <b>serverAbyss</b> servers.

<p>You can use this, among other things, to find out the IP address of the
XML-RPC client.

<p>This class was new in Xmlrpc-c Release 1.19 (June 2009).  Before that,
information about how the XML-RPC call arrived is not available to your
XML-RPC method.


<h4 id="callInfo_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>You don't construct or destroy a <b>callInfo_serverAbyss</b>.
Methods of <b>serverAbyss</b> do that &mdash; you just follow a pointer to it
and use it.

<h4 id="callInfo_serverAbyss"><b>serverAbyssP</b> Member</h4>

<p>Member <b>serverAbyssP</b> is a pointer to the <b>serverAbyss</b> object
that is the XML-RPC server through which the call arrived.

<p><b>serverAbyss</b> per se doesn't contain any members that are useful to
your XML-RPC method, but derived class members might.  For example, you might
have defined a derived class of <b>serverAbyss</b> called
<b>serverAbyssXyz</b> and endowed it with information you want your XML-RPC
method to have.  Your XML-RPC method, then, need only do a dynamic cast of
<b>serverAbyssP *</b> to <b>serverAbyssXyz *</b> and use that pointer to
access your information.

<h4 id="callInfo_sessionAbyss"><b>sessionAbyssP</b> Member</h4>

<p>Member <b>sessionAbyssP</b> is a pointer to the Abyss session object (type
<b>TSession</b>) through which the XML-RPC call arrived.  An Abyss session is
essentially an HTTP transaction.  In the simplest HTTP, it is also a TCP
connection; but more sophisticated HTTP has persistent connections, which
means a single TCP connection can host multiple Abyss sessions.

<p>You can use <b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b>'s <a
href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html#SessionGetRequestInfo"><b>SessionGetRequestInfo()</b></a>
and <a
href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html#SessionGetChannelInfo">SessionGetChannelInfo</a> to
get information about how the RPC arrived.

<p>You're not supposed to use the Abyss session object in any other way
&mdash; <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> owns it.

<p>Here is an example of getting the IP address and TCP port number of
the XML-RPC client, assuming you're using a conventional Abyss server
that uses conventional Unix sockets:

<pre>
<code>

class testCallInfoMethod : public xmlrpc_c::method2 {
public:
    void
    execute(xmlrpc_c::paramList        const&amp; paramList,
            const xmlrpc_c::callInfo * const  callInfoPtr,
            xmlrpc_c::value *          const  retvalP) {

        const xmlrpc_c::callInfo_serverAbyss * const callInfoP(
            dynamic_cast&lt;const xmlrpc_c::callInfo_serverAbyss *&gt;(callInfoPtr));

        void * chanInfoPtr;    
        SessionGetChannelInfo(callInfoP-&gt;abyssSessionP, &amp;chanInfoPtr);

        struct abyss_unix_chaninfo * const chanInfoP(
            static_cast&lt;struct abyss_unix_chaninfo *&gt;(chanInfoPtr));
        
        struct sockaddr const clientAddr(chanInfoP-&gt;peerAddr);

        // Now pick apart 'clientAddr' in the usual way to get to the
        // IP address and port number.  It is the same type of data you
        // would get from POSIX accept().

        ...
    }
</code>
</pre>

<p>There is a complete working example of this in the Xmlrpc-c source tree as
<a
href="http://xmlrpc-c.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xmlrpc-c/trunk/examples/cpp/xmlrpc_sample_add_server.cpp?view=markup">
<b>examples/cpp/callinfo_abyss_server.cpp</b> </a>.  It implements an XML-RPC
method <b>getCallInfo</b> which returns a text message containing the IP
address and TCP port number of the XML-RPC client.


<h3 id="set_handlers"><b>server_abyss_set_handlers</b> function</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_c::server_abyss_set_handlers</b> is a function that
marries an Xmlrpc-c XML-RPC method registry object to an Abyss server
object so that the Abyss server executes the XML-RPC methods.

<h4 id="set_handlers_overview">Overview</h4>
<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_c::xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers(
    TServer *            const srvP,
    xmlrpc_c::registry * const registryP,
    std::string          const uriPath = &quot;/RPC2&quot;
);
</code>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_c::xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers(
    TServer *             const srvP,
    xmlrpc_c::registryPtr const registryP,
    std::string           const uriPath = &quot;/RPC2&quot;
);
</code>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_c::xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers(
    TServer *            const  srvP,
    xmlrpc_c::registry   const&amp; registry,
    std::string          const  uriPath = &quot;/RPC2&quot;
);
</code>
</pre>

<h4 id="set_handlers_description">Description</h4>

<p>This function adds to the Abyss server identied by <i>srvP</i> a
request handler for a URI path you specify.  This handler executes
a POST request as an XML-RPC call as defined by the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
identified by <i>registryP</i>.  It rejects requests with other HTTP
methods for /RPC2 with an HTTP &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot; (code
405) failure.

<p>This function also adds a default request handler, which handles
requests to every URI path other than the one specified.  All that
handler does is fail the request with an HTTP &quot;file not
found&quot; (code 404) error.

<p>You normally call this once per server.  If you call it a second
time, it adds another handler, later in Abyss' search order, for exactly
the same requests, so it has no effect.

<p>Note that you do not use this with a <b>serverAbyss</b> object.
With a <b>serverAbyss</b>, you never see an Abyss object.  A
<b>serverAbyss</b> object has the Abyss server buried inside it and
takes care of setting whatever handlers it needs.

<p>Regardless of how you pass the registry, (reference, simple
pointer, or <b>registryPtr</b>), you must ensure that the registry
continues to exist as along as the Abyss server does.


<h2 id="signals">Signals</h2>

<p>Class <b>serverAbyss</b> has the same considerations for signals as the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#signals">C equivalent</a>.

<p>By default, the <b>run</b> method takes care of all the signal requirements
of the server, but it also expects to own all of the signals of the program,
which means it may not be compatible with the rest of your program.
In particular, if your program receives SIGCHLD signals that aren't from Abyss
children, and you need to see them, you must specify a
<b>serverOwnsSignals(false)</b> constructor option when you construct the
<b>serverAbyss</b> object.

<p><b>serverOwnsSignals(false)</b> causes the <b>serverAbyss</b> object not
to touch signal handlers, and places the responsibility on you to handle
signals as <b>serverAbyss</b> requires.  You have two responsibilities:

<ul>

<li>Make the program handle or ignore SIGPIPE signals.  (Otherwise, you
will find that the OS kills the process if a client hangs up on the server
before the server has sent an RPC response).

<li>If you use a forking Abyss server (that's not normal -- Abyss normally
uses pthreads, but one can built it with a special option that says to use
Unix fork instead):
<p>
Install a handler for SIGCHLD and make it call the <b>serverAbyss</b>
object's <b>sigchld</b> method.  It needs to do this at least for signals that
announce the death of a child of the Abyss server, but it doesn't hurt to call
it for all SIGCHLD signals, since the server knows which ones are for its
children.  Specify a <b>expectSigchld(true)</b> constructor option when you
construct the <b>serverAbyss</b> object to confirm that you have this handler.

<p>If for whatever reason you can't do the SIGCHLD handler, then you can
specify <b>expectSigchld(false)</b> and Abyss will do its best to live without
the signals, but it may cost performance and resources.

</ul>

<p><b>serverOwnsSignals</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.19 (June 2009).  Before
that, <b>run</b> always sets up signal handlers and there is no way to run a
server than handles multiple RPCs at once without messing with your
signals.  The best you can do in those releases is use <b>runOnce</b>
in a loop.

<p><b>runOnce</b> and <b>runConn</b> don't set up any kind of signal handling.
They don't require any SIGCHLD handling, so the only thing you have to do
is set up SIGPIPE to be ignored or handled.


<h2 id="notes"></h2>

<p>This section contains special topics of interest to users of the
facilities described above.


<h3 id="httpauth">HTTP Authentication</h3>

<P>HTTP authentication is the concept of the XML-RPC client, as an
HTTP client, identifying and authenticating itself to the XML-RPC server,
as an HTTP server, using features of the HTTP protocol.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> provides no facilities for doing any of
that.

<p>See further comments on this situation in the discussion of how the
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#httpauth">C libraries</a> don't have this
function either.


<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>If you set the <b>XMLRPC_TRACE_ABYSS</b> environment variable to 1,
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>'s Abyss request handler prints a message
to Standard Error each time Abyss calls it.

<p>You can also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a>
environment variable to trace the handler's calls to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server</b> registry.
