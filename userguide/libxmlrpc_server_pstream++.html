<h1>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b> function library, which is part of
XML-RPC For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a
href="libgeneral++.html">General Library Information - C++</a>

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b> library provides C++ classes
for use in a program that is an psuedo-XML-RPC server that uses the
&quot;packet stream&quot; variation of XML-RPC.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html"><b>libxmlrpc++</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b> classes depend on it.

<p>Similarly, you will need the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html">libxmlrpc_server++</a> library.  It
contains C++ classes for XML-RPC servers that are not specific to
packet stream servers.  And <b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b> classes
depend on it.

<p>Finally, you will need <b>libxmlrpc_packetsocket</b>, which provides
the packet stream functions.

<p>Note that Xmlrpc-c does not provide a C version of this facility.

<p>All of the facilities in this chapter were new in Xmlrpc-c 1.11
(June 2007).

<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++</b> library is
<b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream++.so</b>.
The classic linker option to cause the library to be linked into your
program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server_pstream++</tt>.  These are hints; you'll
have to modify this according to conventions of your particular
platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the library resides
and how to make your linker look there for it.

<p>You can use <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>, specifying the
&quot;c++2&quot; and &quot;pstream-server&quot; features, to find out
what libraries to link.  This is designed to be used in a build
program such as a make file.  When properly installed, it tells
exactly how to link on your particular system.

<p>The following libraries are prerequisites of
<b>libxmlrpc_server_pstream</b>, so you'll need to link them in too:

<ul>
<li>libxmlrpc_packetsocket
<li>libxmlrpc_server
<li>libxmlrpc
<li>libxmlrpc_parse
<li>libxmlrpc_xmltok
<li>libxmlrpc_util
</ul>

And remember that some static linkers care about the order in which
you specify the libraries, with the prerequisite libraries having to
come <em>after</em> the prerequiring library.  <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a> is a good way
to make sure you link all the prerequisites in the right order.

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here is a complete example of a pseudo-XML-RPC packet stream server
program.  This program handles exactly one client connection, then
exits.  It expects to be passed the TCP connection for the client
connection on a socket as Standard Input.  That means this would be
appropriate to use with an Inetd superserver.  To turn this program
into a standalone server that handles a series of client connections,
you would just add some logic to accept TCP connections, such as Inetd
has.

<p>This example is for Xmlrpc-c 1.18 and later.

<p>You can find a tested, buildable copy of this program in the
<b>examples</b> directory of the Xmlrpc-c source tree as
<b>pstream_inetd_server.cpp</b>.  That's also how to find a version that works
with older Xmlrpc-c.

<h2 id="packetstream">Packet Stream</h2>

<p>A packet stream is a way to communicate XML-RPC messages that is far
simpler than HTTP.  XML-RPC specifies that messages are communicated
by HTTP, so when you use a packet stream, you are not using XML-RPC,
but something similar (We refer to it as &quot;pseudo-XML-RPC&quot;).

<p>XML-RPC For C/C++ defines a pseudo-XML-RPC protocol that is the same
as XML-RPC except using a packet stream in place of HTTP.  We call it
&quot;packet stream XML-RPC.&quot;

<p>A packet stream is a form of communication that consists of a
sequence of packets in each of two directions.  A packet is a series
of bytes.  The packets of a stream may have varying sizes.  A packet
stream is best exemplified by a Unix sequential packet socket (type
<b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>) (a little-known type that only some Unix-like
operating systems offer).

<p>Packet stream XML-RPC doesn't use a sequential packet socket
because not all systems have them, but it wants to.  Instead, it uses
its own emulation of that kind of socket built over a traditional
stream (<B>SOCK_STREAM</B>) socket.  Each packet stream is uniquely
associated with a stream socket (TCP) connection.  See <a
href="#psprotocol">Packet Stream Protocol</a> for technical detail on
this protocol (not visible to a program using the facilities described
in this chapter).

<p>In packet stream XML-RPC, each XML-RPC message (i.e. XML-RPC call
or XML-RPC response) is one packet.

<p>An important difference between HTTP and a packet stream is that
the packets of a stream are connected to each other -- they form a
session or connection.  In HTTP, each HTTP transaction is independent --
there is no concept of connection.  This means that unlike in true
XML-RPC, in packet stream XML-RPC, you can have a multi-RPC session.

<p>That may not sound significant, because even in true XML-RPC you
can build a connection <em>above</em> XML-RPC by defining login/logout
RPCs.  But it's better than that in one crucial way: when a program
dies, the operating system automatically terminates any TCP
connections to which it is party, which means when a packet stream
XML-RPC client or server program dies, the OS under it ends the XML-RPC
connection.  The XML-RPC correspondent finds out immediately that the
other party is dead.

<p>Furthermore, you can arrange to have the connection end when there
is network or OS failure (on the other end) as well.  (See the
<a href="#keepalive">TCP Keepalive</a> section).

<p>Note that packet stream XML-RPC is not a public standard.  Only
XML-RPC For C/C++ implements it.  So you use it only in applications
where you supply both client and server software.  You can use
<a href="libxmlrpc_client++.html">Xmlrpc-c client facilities</a>,
in particular the <a href="libxmlrpc_client++.html#class_pstream">
<b>xmlrpc_c::clientXmlTransport_pstream</b> object class</a> to
build a suitable packet stream XML-RPC client.


<h2 id="facilities">Description Of Facilities</h2>

<h3 id="class_serverPstream">class <b>serverPstream</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>xmlrpc_c::serverPstream</b> is a
packet stream XML-RPC server that can serve multiple client connections
(not at the same time).

<p>You supply, when you construct the object, a listening socket
in the form of a socket file descriptor.  This socket is already bound
to a network address and in listen mode.

<p>The object accepts TCP connections as they arrive via the listening
socket, and for each connection, processes RPC calls as they arrive.  It
processes the connections and the RPCs serially, in a single thread.

<p>You get much more flexibility with class <a
href="#class_serverPstreamConn"><b>serverPstreamConn</b></a>, but have to write
a little more code.  With <b>serverPstreamConn</b>, for example, you can
entertain multiple clients at once (by coding multiple threads) and you can
have the server <em>initiate</em> a connection with a client rather than wait
for a client to come to it.

<p>This class was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.18 (March 2009).  Before that, use <a
href="#class_serverPstreamConn"><b>serverPstreamConn</b></a>.


<h4 id="pstream_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>Overview:

<pre>
<code>
    serverPstream::serverPstreamConn(constrOpt const&amp; opt);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Examples:

<p>Takes a listening socket on Standard Input:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverPstream server(xmlrpc_c::serverPstream::constrOpt()
                                   .registryP(&amp;myRegistry)
                                   .socketFd(STDIN_FILENO)
                                  );
</code>
</pre>

<p>Same, using an automatic pointer to manage registry lifetime and
an internally accepted client connection:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registryPtr myRegistryP(new xmlrpc_c::registry);
    ...

    int acceptedFd;
    acceptedFd = accept(...)
    ...

    xmlrpc_c::serverPstream server(xmlrpc_c::serverPstream::constrOpt()
                                   .registryPtr(myRegistryP)
                                   .socketFd(acceptedFd);
                                  );
</code>
</pre>

<p>This constructor uses the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#constropt"><i>constrOpt</i> paradigm</a> to
make specifying options easy and flexible, though technically there is
just one C++ parameter.

<p>The option methods are:

<dl>

<dt>registryPtr(xmlrpc_c::registryPtr)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
The pointer takes care of managing the existence of the registry;
you can destroy all your pointers to the registry after the constructor
returns.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>registryP(const xmlrpc_c::registry *)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
You must ensure that the registry to which it points continues to exist
as long as the server (xmlrpc_c::serverPstream object) does.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>socketFd(xmlrpc_socket)

<dd>This identifies a TCP socket that is in the listening state.  Ordinarily,
that means you have executed a socket(), a bind() and a listen() system call.
Note that the port number on which this server accepts connections is built
into this socket.  The server accepts client connections that arrive on this
socket, then executes RPCs from those conections.

<p>This option is mandatory.

</dl>

<h4 id="pstream_runSerial"><b>runSerial</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to accept TCP connections as they
arrive over the associated listening socket, then execute RPCs as they arrive
over those connections, essentially indefinitely.  It does one connection and
one RPC at a time; i.e. it accepts a connection, executes RPCs from that
connection until the client closes the connection, then accepts the next
connection, etc.  For each connection, it receives an RPC call, then
executes the RPC and sends the RPC response, then receives the next RPC
call, etc.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    server.runSerial();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstream::runSerial();
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstream::runSerial(const int * interruptP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>If you don't want something this serial, use a
<a href="#class_serverPstreamConn"><b>serverPstreamConn</b></a> object
instead, and use multiple threads.

<p>If <b>runSerial</b> is between RPCs, it returns immediately when it finds
the interrupt flag *<i>interruptP</i> nonzero.  It checks it (among other
times) immediately after any signal handler returns, so you typically have a
signal handler set it.  Another common usage is to have another thread set the
flag, then send the <b>runSerial</b> thread a signal, whose handler does
nothing, to tell it to check the flag.  The interrupt flag <em>cannot</em>
interrupt an RPC that <b>runSerial</b> is in the middle of executing.  In
particular, it will not break out of an infinite loop or wait in your method
object and it will not stop <b>runSerial</b> from taking as long as it takes
to send the RPC response to the client.  If you set the interrupt flag while
<b>runSerial</b> is executing an RPC, <b>runSerial</b> will return as soon as
it finishes that RPC.

<p>If you use the form of <b>runSerial</b> that doesn't have
<i>interruptP</i>, it does not return early.

<p>After interrupting <b>runSerial</b>, you can invoke it again.


<h4 id="terminate"><b>terminate</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server to stop running (i.e. a <b>runSerial</b>
method call returns; any future <b>runSerial</b> call returns immediately).

<p>It takes effect the next time a client connection closes.

<p>You can call this from a method function, in which case it takes effect
as soon as the connection via which the client invoked that RPC method
closes.

<p>You can call this from a signal handler.  For example, you can make
SIGTERM terminate the server.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    server.terminate();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstream::terminate();
</code>
</pre>




<h3 id="class_callinfo_serverPstream">Class <b>callinfo_serverPstream</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>callinfo_serverPstream</b> is something that gets
passed to your XML-RPC method (i.e. to the <b>execute</b> method of a
<b>xmlrpc_c::method</b> object) to give it information about how the XML-RPC
call arrived.  It is an instance of <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#callinfo"><b>xmlrpc_c::callInfo</b></a> specific
the <b>serverPstream</b> servers.

<p>You can use this, among other things, to find out the IP address of the
XML-RPC client.

<p>This class was new in Xmlrpc-c Release 1.19 (June 2009).  Before that,
information about how the XML-RPC call arrived is not available to your
XML-RPC method.


<h4 id="callInfoPstream_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>You don't construct or destroy a <b>callInfo_serverPstream</b>.  Methods of
<b>serverPstream</b> do that &mdash; you just follow a pointer to it and use
it.

<h4 id="callInfoPstream_serverP"><b>serverP</b> Member</h4>

<p>Member <b>serverP</b> is a pointer to the <b>serverPstream</b>
object that is the XML-RPC server through which the call arrived.

<p><b>serverPstream</b> per se doesn't contain any members that are useful to
your XML-RPC method, but derived class members might.  For example, you might
have defined a derived class of <b>serverPstream</b> called
<b>serverPstreamXyz</b> and endowed it with information you want your XML-RPC
method to have.  Your XML-RPC method, then, need only do a dynamic cast of
<b>serverP *</b> to <b>serverPstreamXyz *</b> and use that pointer to
access your information.

<h4 id="callInfoPstream_clientAddr"><b>clientAddr</b> Member</h4>

<p>This is the socket address of the client end of the client-server
connection.  Assuming it's a TCP connection, this gives you the IP address
and TCP port number of the client.  <b>struct sockaddr</b> is a Unix OS
type; use it as you would with e.g. the POSIX <b>accept()</b> function.


<h4 id="callInfoPstream_clientAddrSize"><b>clientAddrSize</b> Member</h4>

<p>This goes with <a href="#callInfoPstream_clientAddr"><b>clientAddr</b></a>.
Use it as you would use the corresponding address size value with the
POSIX <b>accept()</b> function.


<h3 id="class_serverPstreamConn">class <b>serverPstreamConn</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn</b> is a
single-connection packet stream XML-RPC server.

<p>You supply, when you construct the object, an established TCP
connection to the client, in the form of a socket file descriptor.

<p>When you destroy the object, it shuts down the TCP connection, if
the client has not done so already.

<p>The object processes RPC calls as they arrive over the TCP connection.  It
processes them serially, in a single thread.


<h4 id="pstreamConn_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>Overview:

<pre>
<code>
serverPstreamConn::serverPstreamConn(constrOpt const&amp; opt);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Examples:

<p>Takes an established client connection on Standard Input:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn conn(xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn::constrOpt()
                                     .registryP(&amp;myRegistry)
                                     .socketFd(STDIN_FILENO)
                                     );
</code>
</pre>

<p>Same, using an automatic pointer to manage registry lifetime and
an internally accepted client connection:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registryPtr myRegistryP(new xmlrpc_c::registry);
    ...

    int acceptedFd;
    acceptedFd = accept(...)
    ...

    xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn server(
        xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn::constrOpt()
        .registryPtr(myRegistryP)
        .socketFd(acceptedFd);
        );
</code>
</pre>

<p>This constructor uses the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#constropt"><i>constrOpt</i> paradigm</a> to
make specifying options easy and flexible, though technically there is
just one C++ parameter.

<p>The option methods are:

<dl>

<dt>registryPtr(xmlrpc_c::registryPtr)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
The pointer takes care of managing the existence of the registry;
you can destroy all your pointers to the registry after the constructor
returns.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>registryP(const xmlrpc_c::registry *)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
You must ensure that the registry to which it points continues to exist
as long as the server (xmlrpc_c::serverPstreamConn object) does.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>socketFd(xmlrpc_socket)

<dd>This identifies a TCP socket that is in the connected state.
Ordinarily, that means it is the result of an accept() system call.
The server performs RPCs that arrive from this socket.

<p>This option is mandatory.

</dl>

<h4 id="run"><b>run</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to execute RPCs as they arrive over
the associated connection, until the client terminates the connection.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    server.run();
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>
    extern int interruptFlag;

    class myCallInfo : public xmlrpc_c::callInfo {
    public:
        myCallInfo::myCallInfo(string const&amp; myname) :
            myname(myname) {}
            
        string myname;
    }
    myCallInfo callInfo(&quot;George&quot;);

    interruptFlag = 0;

    server.run(&amp;callInfo, &amp;interruptFlag);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::run();
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::run(const int * interruptP);
</code>
</pre>

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::run(xmrpc_c::callInfo * callInfoP,
                           const int *         interruptP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>For finer control over the processing, use <a
href="#runOnce"><b>runOnce</b></a> or <a
href="#runOnceNoWait"><b>runOnce</b></a> instead.

<p>If <b>run</b> is between RPCs, it returns immediately when it finds the
interrupt flag *<i>interruptP</i> nonzero.  It checks it (among other times)
immediately after any signal handler returns, so you typically have a signal
handler set it.  Another common usage is to have another thread set the flag,
then send the <b>run</b> thread a signal, whose handler does nothing, to tell
it to check the flag.  The interrupt flag <em>cannot</em> interrupt an RPC
that <b>run</b> is in the middle of executing.  In particular, it will not
break out of an infinite loop or wait in your method object and it will not
stop <b>run</b> from taking as long as it takes to send the RPC response
to the client.  If you set the interrupt flag while <b>run</b> is executing an
RPC, <b>run</b> will return as soon as it finishes that RPC.

<p>If you use the form of <b>run</b> that doesn't have
<i>interruptP</i>, it does not return early.

<p>The <i>callInfoP</i> argument points to an object that <b>run</b> passes to
your XML-RPC method execute method.  It is opaque to Xmlrpc-c.  Use this
object to pass information about the context in which the server is running,
if that should affect what RPCs do.  For example, you might include  the IP
address of the XML-RPC client.

<p>If you use the form of <b>run</b> that doesn't have <i>callInfoP</i>,
you have no way to pass context information to your XML-RPC method object.
<i>callInfoP</i> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.19 (June 2009).

<p>This method was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.18 (March 2009).  Before that, just
use <a href="#runOnce"><b>runOnce</b></a> in a loop.


<h4 id="runOnce"><b>runOnce</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to process one RPC
(waiting for one if necessary).  It waits for the next
packet to arrive from the client, executes the indicated RPC
(which includes sending a packet as a response), and returns.

<p>If before a call arrives the client terminates the connection,
the method returns at that time, with an indication that no more
RPCs will be forthcoming.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    for (bool clientHasDisconnected = false; !clientHasDisconnected;)
        server.runOnce(&amp;clientHasDisconnected);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::runOnce(bool * eofP);
</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code>

<p><b>runOnce</b> returns *<i>eofP</i> true if the client terminated
the connection before the method received an RPC call (and therefore
the method didn't receive an RPC call).  Otherwise, it returns
*<i>eofP</i> false.

<p>Ordinarily, you invoke this method in a loop until either it
reports that the client has disconnected or your program decides
to quit on its own, then you destroy the <b>serverPstreamConn</b>
object.

<p>When <b>runOnce</b> is waiting for the RPC call to arrive, it returns
immediately if it finds the interrupt flag *<i>interruptP</i> nonzero.  It
checks it immediately after any signal handler returns, so you typically have
a signal handler set it.  Another common usage is to have another thread set
the flag, then send the <b>runOnce</b> thread a signal, whose handler does
nothing, to tell it to check the flag.  Another time <b>runOnce</b> checks the
flag is before it does anything.  The interrupt flag has no effect after
<b>runOnce</b> has started executing an RPC.

<p>If you use the form of <b>runOnce</b> that doesn't have <i>interruptP</i>,
it does not return early.

<p><i>interruptP</i> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008).

<h4 id="runOnceNoWait"><b>runOnceNoWait</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method causes the server object to process one RPC, if a packet is
immediately available.  If one is, it executes the indicated RPC (which
includes sending a packet as a response), and returns.  Otherwise, it returns
immediately.

<p>If the client has terminated the connection, the method returns
immediately, with an indication that no more RPCs will be forthcoming.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    for (bool clientHasDisconnected = false; !clientHasDisconnected;) {
        sleep(1);
        server.runOnceNoWait(&amp;clientHasDisconnected);
    }
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::runOnceNoWait(bool * eofP);
</code>
</pre>
<pre>
<code>
    void
    serverPstreamConn::runOnceNoWait(bool * eofP,
                                     bool * didOneP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>What it means for a packet to be immediately available is generally that
the operating system under the client has received one (and it's sitting in an
OS socket buffer).  Specifically, it means either that the client has
previously read a whole packet from the OS socket underlying the packet socket
on which the client is built, or it can read (or finish reading one) now,
while telling the OS it doesn't want to wait for data.

<p><b>runOnceNoWait</b> returns *<i>eofP</i> true if the server has not
received any RPC calls that haven't been executed yet, and the client has
terminated the connection.  Otherwise, it returns *<i>eofP</i> false.

<p><b>runOnceNoWait</b> returns *<i>didOneP</i> true if the client has
received an RPC call (which means <b>runOnceNoWait</b> processed it).
Otherwise, it returns *<i>didOneP</i> false.

<P><B>runOnceNoWait</B> never executes more than one RPC.

<p>Ordinarily, you invoke this method in a loop, which also does other things
unrelated to XML-RPC until either the method reports that the client has
disconnected or your program decides to quit on its own, then you destroy the
<b>serverPstreamConn</b> object.

<p>You may want to use this in conjunction with the POSIX <b>select</b>,
etc.  Use <b>select</b> to determine when data is available to read on
the OS socket on which the client is built.  When you find that data is
available on the socket, call <b>runOnceNoWait</b> to process the
incoming RPC.  Note that data received on the socket doesn't necessarily
mean an entire RPC call was received; the only way to know that is to
run <b>runOnceNoWait</b> and check the *<i>didOneP</i> result.

<p><a href="#runOnce"><b>runOnce</b></a> is the same thing except that
it waits for an RPC call to arrive.

<p><b>runOnceNoWait</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.18 (March 2009).


<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>You can use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a>
environment variable to see the calls and responses from the
<b>libxmlrpc_server</b> registry's point of view.  With a packet
stream server, there is a simple relationship between packet traffic
and registry traffic, so this is essentially the same thing as a
packet trace.

<p>The <b>XMLRPC_TRACE_PACKETSOCKET</b> environment variable traces at a lower
level, showing you packets sent and received on the packet socket as well as
raw bytes (including packet socket escape sequences) read.  This feature was
new in Xmlrpc-c 1.41 (March 2015).


<h2 id="psprotocol">Packet Stream Protocol</h2>

<p>This section describes the protocol that packet stream XML-RPC uses
to transport XML-RPC messages.  The protocol itself is independent of
XML-RPC -- it merely transports arbitrary packets.

<p>The goal of the protocol is to emulate a Unix sequential packet
socket (type <b>SOCK_SEQPACKET</b>), but work on more systems than
have packet stream socket function.  The idea is a hybrid of two far
more common socket types: stream (type <b>SOCK_STREAM</b>) and
datagram (type <B>SOCK_DGRAM</B>).  We want to have connections and
reliable, in-order delivery like with a stream socket, but identified
and indivisible packets like a datagram socket.  Note that a stream
socket handles a stream of bytes, not packets.  A datagram socket
transfers whole packets, such that when you write to the socket, you
write exactly one packet (if any), and when you read from a socket,
you get exactly one packet (if any).

<p>The packet stream protocol is based on a Unix stream socket.  A
Unix stream socket is usually an interface to a TCP connection.  We
will refer to the stream of bytes transported by this stream socket
as &quot;the byte stream.&quot;

<h3 id="psencoding">Encoding of Packet Stream Into Byte Stream</h3>

<p>Example:
<pre>
<tt>
    P a c k e t O n e <i>&lt;esc&gt;</i> P K T 
    E s c a p e : <i>&lt;esc&gt;</i> E S C . <i>&lt;esc&gt;</i> P K T
</tt>
</pre>

(white space and line breaks in the example are for display only).

<p>In the byte stream, the ASCII code for the Escape character
(<tt><i>&lt;esc&gt;</i></tt>), which is 0x1B, is an escape
character -- it introduces a 4 byte protocol control word.  We specify
the 4 bytes of a control word with ASCII characters such that the 4
bytes are the ASCII encoding of 4 ASCII characters.  The first one is
of course always <tt><i>&lt;esc&gt;</i></tt>.

<p>The byte stream is partitioned into packet frames.  The first
packet frame begins with the first byte of the byte stream.  Each
packet frame ends with a packet delimiter, which is the control word
<tt><I>&lt;esc&gt;</I> P K T </tt>.  It is a protocol error for the
byte stream to end anywhere except immediately after a packet
delimiter or at the very beginning of the byte stream.

<p>Within a packet frame, every byte that is not part of a control
word represents a byte of the packet with the same value, in the same order.

<p>Within a packet frame, the control word <tt><i>&lt;esc&gt;</i> E S C</tt>
represents the byte 0x1B (ASCII Escape) in the packet.

<p>It is a protocol error for the byte stream to contain any control
word other than the two mentioned here.

<p>While ASCII is used to specify some of the protocol, this does not
imply that the protocol is about ASCII or text or characters.  A packet
consists of arbitrary bytes.

<p>The <b>libxmlprc_packetsocket</b> library, part of Xmlrpc-c,
provides facilities for having a packet stream conversation.  This
library does not involve XML-RPC.

<h2 id="keepalive">TCP Keepalive</h2>

<p>The TCP keepalive function is important to users of Packet Stream
XML-RPC.  One of the big advantages of Packet Stream XML-RPC over
regular XML-RPC is that a client or server can know when its peer dies
(or, equivalently, becomes unreachable over the network).  TCP keepalive
is part of what makes that possible.

<p>TCP keepalive is not in effect for a default TCP connection.  Such
a connection ends only when the OS on one side acts to end it.
Usually, that's because the OS user of the socket closed it, but it
can also be because the OS forcibly closed the socket because the user
process terminated.  But what if the OS itself or something below it dies?
For example, the OS could hang, or the power could fail on the computer
that's running it, or a network cable could get cut.  In that case, the
default TCP connection can live indefinitely.  The OS on the surviving
end will not notice anything wrong until it tries to send data and, after
retries and waits, fails to get an acknowledgement.

<p>TCP keepalive allows the surviving end to find out more timely that
the other end is gone.  To activate it, you set the SO_KEEPALIVE
socket-level option on the socket, using the POSIX setsockopt()
function.  On many systems (including Linux), you can control the
specifics of the keepalive function with the TCP-level socket options
(which you set also with setsockopt()) TCP_KEEPIDLE, TCP_KEEPINTVL,
and TCP_KEEPCNT.

<p>With the keepalive function, the OS periodically sends empty
segments to the other side.  If it fails to get an acknowledgement, it
declares the peer dead and closes the connection.  Assuming the TCP
socket underlies an Xmlrpc-c packet socket, that packet socket closes
as well, and any attempt to read from it fails.  If a process is in
the middle of method that waits for data to arrive, that method
returns a failure at that time.

<p>In Xmlrpc-c, you create a packet socket out of a fully-formed TCP socket,
so it is your choice whether to have keepalive active on it, and the specific
parameters of it.  You nearly always do want it.  If your application doesn't
need to know that the peer still exists, then it is probably the kind of
application that would work better with normal connectionless XML-RPC.

<h2 id="nagle">TCP Nagling</h2>

<p>The TCP Nagle function is important to some users of Packet Stream
XML-RPC.  This is a function whereby the OS delays transmission of TCP
data.  To reduce utilization of TCP resources such as network link
time, the OS may hold off on sending data to wait for additional data
to send.  If the application requests the sending of more data soon
enough, the OS sends all of the data in a single packet, thus saving
resources compared to sending multiple packets.  The policy by which
the OS decides when to wait and how long is called the Nagle
Algorithm, named after its inventor.  The process of doing the waiting
is called nagling.

<p>The OS does nagling by default, but you can tell it not to (disable
nagling) for a particular TCP socket.  When nagling is disabled, the
OS sends IP packets as soon as it can.  You control nagling with the
TCP-level socket option (which you set with setsockopt()) TCP_NODELAY.

<p>Nagling is not as valuable as it seems, because it conserves
resources mainly on systems where resource contention isn't a problem.
If a network link is actually congested, the OS will not be able to
send a packet as soon as the application asks it to send some data, so
it will end up accumulating small send requests into large packets
anyway.  Nagling causes the OS to refrain from sending only when there
<em>are</em> resources available to send.  Still, Nagling can be a
useful hack to allocate resources in some simple systems.

<p>An Xmlrpc-c packet server ordinarly makes three send requests
(socket writes) per RPC call or response (packet header, packet body,
packet trailer).  A typical RPC call or result fits in one IP packet.
So without nagling, on an unloaded network, you would see 6 IP packets
per RPC, whereas with nagling, you would see 2.

<p>On a system I measured, the Nagle Algorithm slowed a continuous
serial RPC process down to 12 RPCs per second.

<p>In Xmlrpc-c, you create a packet socket out of a fully-formed TCP
socket, so it is your choice whether to have the OS perform nagling or
not.
