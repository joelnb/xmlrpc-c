<h1>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> function library, which is part of XML-RPC
For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a href="libgeneral.html">General
Library Information - C</a>

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> library provides C++ classes for use
in a program that is an XML-RPC server based on CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) scripts run by a web server.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html"><b>libxmlrpc++</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> classes depend on it.

<p>Similarly, you will need the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html">libxmlrpc_server++</a> library.  It
contains functions for XML-RPC servers that are not specific to
CGI-based servers.  And <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> classes
depend on it.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.16 (December
2008).  The C version, <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> is much older.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlrpc_server_cgi.hpp&gt;</B> header file
declares the interface to <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b>.

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it, or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.

<p>Because various other Xmlrpc-c libraries are prerequisites (and
<b>xmlrpc_server_cgi.hpp</b> includes them), you'll also need their
header files.  It's easiest just to have the entire Xmlrpc-c package
available.


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> library is
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++.so</b>.
The classic linker option to cause the library to be linked into your
program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server_cgi++</tt>.  These are hints; you'll
have to modify this according to conventions of your particular
platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the library resides
and how to make your linker look there for it.  Or use 
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<p>The following libraries are prerequisites of <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b>,
so you'll need to link them in too:

<ul>
<li>libxmlrpc_server++
<li>libxmlrpc_server
<li>libxmlrpc++
<li>libxmlrpc
<li>libxmlrpc_parse
<li>libxmlrpc_xmltok
<li>libxmlrpc_util
</ul>

And remember that some static linkers care about the order in which
you specify the libraries, with the prerequisite libraries having to
come <em>after</em> the prerequiring library.  <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a> is a good way
to make sure you link all the prerequisites in the right order.

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>Here is an example of a C++ CGI program that uses
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b> to effect an XML-RPC server.

<pre>
<code>
    #include &lt;cassert&gt;
    #include &lt;iostream&gt;
    
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/base.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/registry.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/server_cgi.hpp&gt;
    
    using namespace std;
    
    class sampleAddMethod : public xmlrpc_c::method {
    public:
        sampleAddMethod() {
            // signature and help strings are documentation -- the client
            // can query this information with a system.methodSignature and
            // system.methodHelp RPC.
            this-&gt;_signature = &quot;i:ii&quot;;  // method's arguments, result are integers
            this-&gt;_help = &quot;This method adds two integers together&quot;;

            *retvalP = xmlrpc_c::value_int(addend + adder);
        }
    };
    
    
    
    int 
    main(int           const, 
         const char ** const) {

            xmlrpc_c::methodPtr const sampleAddMethodP(new sampleAddMethod);
    
            myRegistry.addMethod(&quot;sample.add&quot;, sampleAddMethodP);
    
            xmlrpc_c::serverCgi myServer(
                xmlrpc_c::serverCgi::constrOpt()
                .registryP(&amp;myRegistry));
    
            myServer.processCall();
    
        } catch (exception const&amp; e) {
            cerr << &quot;Something failed.  &quot; << e.what() << endl;
        }
        return 0;
    }

<p>This program, with procedures to build it, is in the Xmlrpc-c
source tree as <b>examples/cpp/xmlrpc_sample_add_server_cgi.cpp</b>.

<h2 id="aboutcgi">About CGI</h2>

<p>The <a href="libxmlrpc_server_cgi.html#aboutcgi">manual</a> for
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b>'s C cousin has some useful information on
what CGI is about and how this library fits into it.  The C++
library fits in the same way, just for a different language.

<h2 id="facilities">Description Of Facilities</h2>

<h3 id="class_serverCgi">class <b>serverCgi</b></h3>

<p>An object of class <b>xmlrpc_c::serverCgi</b> is the XML-RPC engine
inside an XML-RPC server.  The object does the XML-RPC part of executing
<em>one</em> XML-RPC call, connecting to the HTTP server that does the
rest of the work via CGI.

<p>You use the object like this: your HTTP server, upon receiving an
XML-RPC call, calls your CGI program.  Your CGI program creates a
<b>serverCgi</b> object, executes its <b>processCall</b> method, the
destroys the object and exits.  <b>processCall</b> gets information
about the XML-RPC call via the CGI interface and delivers information
for the XML-RPC response via the CGI interface.

<p>You supply the XML-RPC methods for the server to execute as an <a
href="libxmlrpc_server++.html#method_registry">Xmlrpc-c method
registry</a>.  Though there's only one particular method that needs to
execute (because there's only one XML-RPC call) you normally build a
registry with all of the server's methods so your code doesn't have
to decide which method is required.


<h4 id="serverCgi_example">Example</h4>

<p>See <a href="#example">above</a>.


<h4 id="serverCgi_constructors">Constructors</h4>

<p>Overview:

<pre>
<code>
serverCgi::serverCgi(constrOpt const&amp; opt);
</code>
</pre>

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_c::registry myRegistry;
    ...
    xmlrpc_c::serverCgi cgiServer(xmlrpc_c::serverCgi::constrOpt()
                                  .registryP(&amp;myRegistry));
</code>
</pre>

<p>This constructor uses the <a
href="libxmlrpc++.html#constropt"><i>constrOpt</i> paradigm</a> to
make specifying options easy and flexible, though technically there is
just one C++ parameter.

<p>The option methods are:

<dl>

<dt>registryPtr(xmlrpc_c::registryPtr)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
The pointer takes care of managing the existence of the registry;
you can destroy all your pointers to the registry after the constructor
returns.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

<dt>registryP(const xmlrpc_c::registry *)

<dd>This is a pointer to the method registry the server is to use.
You must ensure that the registry to which it points continues to exist
as long as the server (xmlrpc_c::serverAbyss object) does.

<p>You must specify either <b>registryPtr</b> or <b>registry</b>, and
not both.

</dl>


<h4 id="processCall"><b>processCall</b> Method</h4>

<p>This method does the XML-RPC part of executing an XML-RPC call.
The entire point of your CGI program is to call this method once.  It
communicates with the web server via the CGI interface to get the
XML-RPC call information and supply the XML-RPC response information.

<p>The heart of what <b>processCall</b> does is call one of the method
functions that you registered in the method registry tied to the
<b>serverCgi</b> object.

<p><b>processCall</b> does its best to respond to any problems it has
by generating an appropriate XML-RPC or HTTP error response.  But if
problems are so basic that it can't do that, it throws an error.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    cgiServerP-&gt;processCall();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void processCall();
</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>If you set the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a>
environment variable to 1, the CGI program prints to Standard Error
the XML that it processes and returns.  This is not much more
informative than trace facilities that are probably available in your
web server.  But at least it will help you confirm that the CGI
program is running and you are using the method registry correctly.
