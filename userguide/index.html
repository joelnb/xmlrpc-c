<h2 id="preface">Preface: About This Manual</h2>

<p>This is the manual for users of XML-RPC for C/C++.

<p>The manual documents all current and past releases of XML-RPC for
C/C++ and even planned future releases.  Each part of the manual
tells you to what releases it applies.  Since the main difference
between releases is that newer ones have more features, this mainly
means that the description of a feature tells you in what release it
was added to the package.

<p>Compared to the more common system of distributing manuals keyed to
particular releases, this makes the manual harder to use for some
users (to wit, a user who has no intention of using any but one
particular release), but it allows for a higher quality manual for
past releases, with the same publication effort.  It also allows
additional uses: writing portable code and discovering when you could
benefit by moving to a newer release.

<p>For more information about the document, see
<a href="#thisdoc">About This Document</a>.


<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>XML-RPC for C/C++ is a software package of programming libraries to
help a C or C++ program use XML-RPC.  In particular, a C/C++
programmer can easily write a program to be an XML-RPC client or
server.

<P>XML-RPC for C/C++ is also known as Xmlrpc-c.

<h3 id="whatisxml-rpc">What is XML-RPC?</h3>

<p>XML-RPC is a standard network protocol that computers can use to talk
to each other in a remote procedure call fashion.  Remote procedure call
essentially means that a program on one computer runs a program on another
computer.  But a simpler way of looking at this kind of network protocol
is just that you have clients and servers.  A client makes individual
isolated requests of a server.  A server sits around waiting for a
request to arrive from some client, does what the request asks, and 
sends a response.  It then goes back to waiting for the next request.

<p>Here are some examples of remote procedure call (RPC) style
communications:
<ul>
<li>There is a server that can measure atmospheric temperature.  A client
anywhere in the world can ask the server at any time what the temperature
is.  The &quot;what temperature is it?&quot; request and the &quot;the
temperature is...&quot; response constitute an RPC transaction.

<li>There is a server that can turn a light on or off.  A client can tell
the server to turn the light on.  A request to turn the light on and the
acknowledgement that the light has been turned on constitute an RPC
transaction.

<li>There is a server that knows the phone numbers of a million people.
A client can supply a name and get back the phone number of the named
person.

<li>A network of 1000 computers is used to search millions of web
pages.  A dispatcher computer is a client and the rest are servers.
The dispatcher sends each of the servers one URL at a time and some
search terms.  The server responds with yes or no as to whether the
page with that URL contains the search terms.  The dispatcher keeps a
list of the URLs that match.  Each of the requests to search a
particular URL is an RPC transaction.

</ul>

<p>Here are some kinds of communication that are <em>not</em> RPC:

<ul>
<li>A long-lived connection such as an SSH login session.

<li>A high volume transfer such as an FTP download.

<li>A one-way transmission such as a UDP packet.

<li>A dialogue such as an SMTP (mail) transaction.

</ul>

<p>The original RPC protocol is the ONC RPC protocol -- the one that
NFS (the network fileystem protocol) uses.  It's often called
&quot;Sun RPC&quot; because Sun invented and promulgated it.  The ONC
RPC protocol is layered over UDP or sometimes TCP and uses a
machine-friendly bits and bytes format, just like the TCP/IP layers
under it.

<p>XML-RPC differs from ONC RPC in that it encodes the information in
the requests and responses in XML.  That means they are human friendly
-- XML is human-readable text, so a human can readily see what's
going on from a network trace and quickly write code to create and
decipher XML-RPC streams.  Of course, the tradeoff is that XML-RPC
uses way more network and computation resources than ONC RPC.  Because
XML-RPC is meant to be used for relatively small and infrequent
transactions, this is thought not to matter.

<p>In XML-RPC, the aforementioned XML is transported via HTTP (the
protocol whose principal purpose is to implement web serving -- web
browsing is a form of RPC, after all).  HTTP is normally carried over
TCP, which is carried over IP.

<p>There are lots of servers in the world that use the XML-RPC
protocol and lots of programs and programming libraries from which
people can build XML-RPC-based servers and clients.

<p>There are also other HTTP-based RPC protocols.  SOAP and CORBA are
the most famous.  REST-RPC is a more recent entry.

<p>For more information on XML-RPC, see <a
href="http://www.xmlrpc.com/">The XML-RPC web site</a> and <a
href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/XML-RPC-HOWTO/index.html">The XML-RPC
Howto</a>.  The latter includes information (with examples) on
implementing XML-RPC clients and servers in languages other than C and
C++, which is all that is covered in this document.

<h3 id="howdoesithelp">How Does XML-RPC For C/C++ Help with XML-RPC?</h3>

<p>The function libraries in XML-RPC For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c) let you
write a program that makes XML-RPC calls (a client) or executes
XML-RPC calls (a server program) at any of various levels of
understanding of the XML-RPC protocol.

<p>Here are <a href="#examples">some examples of client and server code</a>.


<h3 id="xmlrpc-c">More Information On XML-RPC For C/C++</h3>

<p>This manual is a user's guide, meant to tell you how to write programs
using the library.  It does not cover such things as how Xmlrpc-c is developed
or how to get or install it for use.

<p>The master source of information about Xmlrpc-c is the
<a href="http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/">Xmlrpc-c web site</a>.


<h2 id="libraries">The Xmlrpc-c Function Libraries</h2>

<p>This is a list of the function libraries Xmlrpc-c provides, with links
to the manual for each.

<p>There are two sets of libraries -- C and C++.  You can of course
use the C libraries in a C++ program, but you cannot in general mix
the two -- you use either the C Xmlrpc-c facilities or the C++
Xmlrpc-c facilities.  The C++ libraries depend heavily on the C
libraries, but apart from having to install and link to the C
libraries, you won't see that from the outside.

<p>The C++ libraries were all new in Xmlrpc-c 1.03 (June 2005).

<p>There is an older C++ facility, which is just a thin wrapper around
the C libraries.  We do not document it in this manual or recommend
it, but it remains part of Xmlrpc-c for backward compatibility.  This
library consists in the header file <b>xmlrpc-c/oldcppwrapper.hpp</b>
(fka <b>XmlRpcCpp.h</b>) and the library <b>libxmlrpc_cpp</b>.

<h2 id="utilities">Utility Programs</h2>

<p>Xmlrpc-c comes with a few utility programs that you can use to
diagnose problems or learn about XML-RPC or Xmlrpc-c.  These programs
double as examples of how to use the Xmlrpc-c function libraries.

<p>Because the utility programs are not essential to the package,
the default install tools don't install them at all.  The builder does
build them, though, and if you build Xmlrpc-c from source, you will
find them all in the <b>tools/</b> directory.

<p>You'll also find more complete documentation there.

<h3 id="xmlrpc">xmlrpc</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc</b> is a general purpose XML-RPC client program.  It
performs one XML-RPC call, which you describe in its command line
arguments.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc http://localhost:8080/RPC2 sample.add i/3 i/5
</kbd>
</pre>

This makes a call to the XML-RPC server at the indicated URL, for the
method named &quot;sample.add&quot;, with two arguments: the integer 3
and the integer 5.

<p><b>xmlrpc</b> prints to Standard Output the result of the call, which
it gets back from the server.

<p>You can abbreviate the URL; <B>xmlrpc</B> assumes &quot;http://&quot;
and &quot;/RPC2&quot;:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc localhost:8080 sample.add i/3 i/5
Result:
  Integer: 8
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>The port number defaults to 80, so you can abbreviate even more:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc localhost sample.add i/3 i/5
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>String arguments look like this:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc http://www.xmlrpc.com/RPC2 method_that_takes_string s/hello
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>If you don't include a type specifier such as &quot;i/&quot; or
&quot;s/&quot;, <b>xmlrpc</b> assumes &quot;s/&quot;.  So you can use
this shortcut, equivalent to the above:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc http://www.xmlrpc.com/RPC2 method_that_takes_string hello
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Each argument to <b>xmlrpc</b> describes on XML-RPC parameter.  So
in a typical command shell, the following would make an XML-RPC call
with two paramters: &quot;hello&quot; and &quot;see you later&quot;:

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc http://www.xmlrpc.com/RPC2 mymethod s/hello &quot;s/see you later&quot;
</kbd>
</pre>

<p>Compound values for parameters look the following, except that these
aren't implemented yet.  Only &quot;i/&quot; and &quot;s/&quot; are
implemented right now.

<p>Note that this is an example of a Bourne shell command, so some of
the characters (most notably the quotation marks) are part of the shell
language, not the <b>xmlrpc</b> syntax.

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/xml-rpc/server.php \
    meerkat.getItems \
    &quot;struct/{search:linux,descriptions:i/76,time_period:12hour}&quot;
Result:
  Array:
    Struct:
      title: String: DatabaseJournal: OpenEdge-Based Finance ...
      link: String: http://linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=...
      description: String: "Finance application with embedded ...
    Struct:
      title: ...
      link: ...
      description: ...

</kbd>
</pre>

<pre>
<kbd>
$ xmlrpc localhost:8080 array_processing_method \
    &quot;array/(i/3,i/49,s/hello,array/(i/-10,i/-9))&quot;
</kbd>
</pre>

<p><b>xmlrpc</b> is implemented using the Xmlrpc-c client library, but
its function is not in any way tied to Xmlrpc-c.  It makes a standard
XML-RPC call and does not know or care whether the server is
implemented with Xmlrpc-c or not.

<p>For extra diagnostic information, use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_client.html#trace_xml"><b>XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</b>
environment variable</a> so you can see the XML that goes back and
forth to perform the call.  (This is not specifically <b>xmlrpc</b>
function -- it's tracing function that's automatically there because
<b>xmlrpc</b> uses <b>libxmlrpc_client</b>).

<h4>Warning About System Compatibility</h4>

<p><b>xmlrpc</b> from Xmlrpc-c before Release 1.16 doesn't work on some
platforms &mdash; it crashes due to invalid assumptions it makes about the
way C variadic functions are implemented.


<h2 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h2>

<P>This section describes some alternatives to using XML-RPC For
C/C++.

<h3 id="otherlang">Other Progamming Languages</h3>

<p>There are plenty of facilities to help you create XML-RPC clients
and servers in a language other than C or C++.  Search on <a
href="http://freshmeat.net">Freshmeat</a>.

<p>It is worth mentioning that with some of these other-language
facilities, the client or server is way slower than with XML-RPC for
C/C++, due to the nature of the language.  For example, I have used
the Perl <b>RPC::XML</b> modules from CPAN and found a client program
that takes 50 milliseconds to run when written with XML-RPC For C And
C++ takes 2000 milliseconds to run when done with RPC::XML::Client.

<p>In the case of Perl, there is a middle ground.  The
<b>RPC::Xmlrpc_c</b> modules from CPAN are based on Perl extensions
that use the libraries of XML-RPC For C And C++.  One reason
<b>RPC::XML</b> is so slow is that it is built on top of a stack about
6 layers high, each one implemented in interpreted Perl.  With
<b>RPC::Xmlrpc_c</b>, all those layers except the top are implemented
as executable machine code, efficiently compiled from C, so you have
the same ease of Perl coding, without the slowness.

<p><b>RPC::Xmlrpc_c</b> is much younger than <b>RPC::XML</b>, so
doesn't have many features, and in fact does not include any server
facilities.  But you could add missing features yourself (and,
ideally, submit them for inclusion in the <b>RPC::Xmlrpc_c</b> package
on CPAN, so others can use them).

<p><b>RPC::Xmlrpc_c</b> was new in December 2006 and needs
XML-RPC For C And C++ Release 1.08 or better.

<p>In other interpreted languages, the same hybrid may be possible --
replacing slow interpreted code with executable XML-RPC libraries.


<h3 id="apache">Apache Module</h3>

<p>You can make a nice XML-RPC server based on an Apache HTTP server (which
may or may not simultaneously be a regular web server) using an Apache module.

<p>There once was an Apache module based on Xmlrpc-c, so you could use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#howto">same method code</a> as you do for other
Xmlrpc-c-based implementations.  It was called <b>mod_xmlrpc</b> and is
described by a <a
href="http://freshmeat.net/projects/mod_xmlrpc">Freshmeat</a> entry, but as of
April 2009, the download link is dead.

<p>Another module, also called <b>mod_xmlrpc</b>, is distributed via a <a
href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/mod-xmlrpc">Sourceforge project</a>, but
hasn't been updated since 2001, is undocumented, and looks pretty weak.

<p>An even simpler, though less efficient and more limited way to make
an XML-RPC server out of an Apache server is to do it via a CGI
script.  That script can be written in a variety of languages, but if
you write it in C, you can use Xmlrpc-c's <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_cgi.html">libxmlrpc_server_cgi</a> library.

<h3 id="otherprotocol">Other RPC Protocols</h3>

<p>SOAP and CORBA are common alternatives to XML-RPC.  Lots of expensive
commercial software helps you use those.  There is more to know and more
you can do with them.

<p>REST-RPC was invented in 2006 and was meant to be superior to
XML-RPC for at least some things.  It is easier to use in many ways
than XML-RPC.  Like XML-RPC, it uses HTTP, and like XML-RPC an RPC's
result is XML.  But unlike XML-RPC, a call is <em>not</em> XML.  It is
encoded entirely in the query part of a URL.  (Example:
<tt>http:/test.rest-rpc.org/?_function=GetCart&amp;cart=1563</tt>).
In the result, there are no inherent data types; server and client
agree on those separately.  The <a
href="http://xins.sourceforge.net/restrpc.html">Xins</a> project has
more information.

<p><a href="http://json-rpc.org">JSON-RPC</a> is like XML-RPC using JSON
instead of XML, but isn't really an RPC protocol at all.  It is a protocol for
sending arbitrary messages back and forth between two communicants (whereas in
an RPC protocol, the messages must have a request/response relationship).
JSON is a way of representing typical program data structures such as integers
and arrays in text, and is much simpler than XML-RPC XML elements or indeed
any XML.  It is far easier for a person to read a JSON-RPC message than to
read an XML-RPC message.  JSON-RPC was developed after XML-RPC.

<h2 id="appendices">Appendices</h2>

<h3 id="examples">Introductory Examples</h3>

<p>Here, to show you what Xmlrpc-c is, we present example code (almost
an entire C program) for a simple XML-RPC client that exploits the
Xmlrpc-c libraries, and a corresponding simple XML-RPC server.

<p>There is not enough here for you just to copy and paste it and build
the program, because there is more than Xmlrpc-c details to building a
program.  

<p>The Xmlrpc-c website has a page
of <a href="http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/example-code.php">full examples</a>
for each of these programs, and we provide links to the relevant files along
with the examples below.

<p>But even that leaves some work for you to do, figuring out how to compile
it with your tools and for your environment.

<p><em>You can find complete working versions</em> of these, with a working
build system, and lots of other examples in the <b>examples/</b> directory in
the Xmlrpc-c source tree.  You will probably have an easier time getting
started with Xmlrpc-c starting from those examples than by cutting and pasting
the code shown below.

<p>In these examples, the service to be provided is adding of two
numbers.  You wouldn't do this with RPC in real life, of course,
because a program can add two numbers without the help of a remote
server.  This is just to demonstrate the concept.

<p>See
the <a href="http://xmlrpc-c.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/xmlrpc-c/super_stable/examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_server.c?view=markup">complete
source file</a> in the Xmlrpc-c source tree.

<p>There's a lot going on under the covers of this example server.
What the xmlrpc_server_abyss() statement does is run a whole HTTP
server.  The function doesn't normally return.  The HTTP server runs
the <b>abyss</b> web server (i.e. HTTP server) program.  <b>abyss</b>
is like the more serious web server program <b>apache</b>, but on a
much smaller scale.  An XML-RPC call is just an HTTP POST request, so
while <b>abyss</b> was not designed specifically for XML-RPC, it
provides much of the function an XML-RPC server needs.

<p>The only way this Abyss web server differs from one you would run
to do traditional web serving is that it contains a special handler to
call Xmlrpc-c functions to handle an XML-RPC POST request.  The server
calls that handler for any URI that starts with &quot;/RPC2&quot;,
which is what XML-RPC URIs conventionally have.

<p>While <b>abyss</b> is distributed independently of Xmlrpc-c,
Xmlrpc-c contains an old copy of it, somewhat modified.  So you don't
need to install <b>abyss</b> separately.

<p>In this example, you have to provide an example <b>abyss</b>
configuration file as a program argument.  The main thing you need
that file for is to specify on which TCP port the server will listen.
A single &quot;Port 8080&quot; statement is probably enough.  (I say
8080, because in the example client code above, I hardcoded 8080 as
the port in the URI the client uses).

<p>There are lots of other ways to use Xmlrpc-c libraries to build
XML-RPC clients and servers.  The more code you're willing to write, and
the more involved in the guts of the protocol you want to get, the more
control you can have.

<h4 id="clientexamplepp">Small C++ Client Example</h4>

<p>Here is an example of C++ code that implements an XML-RPC client using
the highest level facilities of Xmlrpc-c.  This client sends a request
to add 5 and 7 together to an XMLRPC-C server that is designed to
provide the service of adding numbers.

<p>The example server <a href="#serverexample">above</a> would be a suitable
server for this client.

<pre>
<code>
...
#include &lt;xmlrpc-c/base.hpp&gt;
#include &lt;xmlrpc-c/client_simple.hpp&gt;

int
main(int argc, char **argv) {

    string const serverUrl(&quot;http://localhost:8080/RPC2&quot;);
    string const methodName(&quot;sample.add&quot;);

    xmlrpc_c::clientSimple myClient;
    xmlrpc_c::value result;
        
    myClient.call(serverUrl, methodName, &quot;ii&quot;, &amp;result, 5, 7);

    int const sum((xmlrpc_c::value_int(result)));
        // Assume the method returned an integer; throws error if not

    cout &lt;&lt; "Result of RPC (sum of 5 and 7): " &lt;&lt; sum &lt;&lt; endl;

    return 0;
}

<p>To keep it brief, we don't catch any thrown errors, though various
parts of this program can throw them.
