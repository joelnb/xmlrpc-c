<h1>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> function library, which is part of
XML-RPC For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a
href="libgeneral.html">General Library Information - C</a>

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> library provides functions for use in
a program that is an XML-RPC server based on the Abyss HTTP server.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> library routines depend on it.

<p>Similarly, you will need the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html">libxmlrpc_server</a> library.  It
contains functions for XML-RPC servers that are not specific to
Abyss-based servers.  And <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> library
routines depend on it.

<p>Finally, you will need Abyss itself, which is in the library
<b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b>, which is part of Xmlrpc-c.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlrpc_server_abyss.h&gt;</B> header file declares the
interface to <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>.

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it.  Or use 
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<p>Because the <b>libxmlrpc</b>, <b>libxmlrpc_server</b>, and
<b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b> libraries are
prerequisites, you'll also need their header files (<b>xmlrpc.h</b>,
<b>xmlrpc_server.h</b>, and <b>xmlrpc_abyss.h</b>).


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> library is
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss.so</b>.
The classic linker option to cause the library to be linked into your
program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server_abyss</tt>.  These are hints; you'll
have to modify this according to conventions of your particular
platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the library resides
and how to make your linker look there for it.

<p>You can use <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>, specifying the
&quot;abyss-server&quot; feature, to find out what libraries to link.
This is designed to be used in a build program such as a make file.
When properly installed, it tells exactly how to link on your
particular system.

<p>The following libraries are prerequisites of <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>,
so you'll need to link them in too:

<ul>
<li>libxmlrpc_abyss
<li>libxmlrpc_server
<li>libxmlrpc
<li>libxmlrpc_parse
<li>libxmlrpc_xmltok
<li>libxmlrpc_util
</ul>

And remember that some static linkers care about the order in which
you specify the libraries, with the prerequisite libraries having to
come <em>after</em> the prerequiring library.  <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a> is a good way
to make sure you link all the prerequisites in the right order.

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>A complete example of an XML-RPC server program that uses
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> is <a
href="index.html#serverexample">here</a>.

<h2 id="aboutabyss">About Abyss</h2>

<p>Abyss is a general purpose HTTP server program.  Because the most
common use of HTTP is in web servers, Abyss is usually called a web
server program.  It is in the same class as the more famous Apache
HTTP server program.  It is much simpler than Apache, though.

<p>Since XML-RPC is implemented over HTTP, all you need for an XML-RPC
server is an Abyss server with a handler attached that knows how to
execute an XML-RPC call.  <b>libxmlrpc_server</b>'s <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
provides all the logic you need to execute an XML-RPC call, so all you
have to do is hook that up to Abyss.  <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>
gives the facilities to make that connection.


<h2 id="styles">Styles Of Abyss-Based Server Programs</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways you can build an XML-RPC server based on an
Abyss HTTP server.

<p>The most basic (but not easiest) is not to use any Xmlrpc-c XML-RPC
facilities at all.  Write your own Abyss request handler which takes
an XML document from Abyss, interprets it as an XML-RPC call, and
returns to Abyss an XML response.  Register that request handler with
Abyss using Abyss function calls.  Create and start up your Abyss
server using Abyss function calls.

<p>The next step up in convenience would be to have your Abyss request
handler use <a href="libxmlrpc.html#xmlencode">Xmlrpc-c's XML encoding
and decoding tools</a> to free you from having to know the XML-RPC
protocol, and other <a href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b></a>
facilities to process the data easily.

<p>The next step up would be to use an Xmlrpc-c method registry.
Instead of writing your own Abyss request handler, call
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>.  That installs a request
handler for your URI path (usually &quot;/RPC2&quot;) that executes an
XML-RPC call.  Abyss delivers all HTTP requests for that URI path to
that handler.  To tell the handler what methods to execute, you build
a <a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
and identify it in <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>'s
arguments.  (The Abyss server thus created rejects requests for any
other URI path).  Now you don't have to know how to write an Abyss
request handler, but you still have to know other parts of the
Abyss API.

<p>The next step up would be to have Xmlrpc-c handle the details of
the Abyss API as well.  To do that, create a <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
object with <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b> and invoke the various
methods of that object.  The object sets up the Abyss server to
execute XML-RPC methods using the method registry you supply.  You
never see Abyss itself.

<p>What you give up for that convenience is that the
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object is not capable of exploiting many of
the features of Abyss.  For example, you can't have the server do any
kind of authentication using this style.

<p>One level up from that is to have the <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
object under the covers as well.  You just run
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>.  It creates the <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
object and runs the server.  It returns when the server terminates.
Because you have no handle for the server object, you can't control
it from outside; in particular, you can't shut it down from another
thread or signal handler.

<p>There is another style in which you don't build a method registry
separately, but rather use <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> facilities to
add individual methods to a server instance.  I don't recommend this
style.  It used to be (before Xmlrpc-c 1.01 - January 2005) the only
one, so continues to exist for backward compatibility, but I find it
to be more complex than the newer <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> style.

<h2 id="ownabyss">Running Your Own Abyss Server</h2>

<p>If in your program you create your own Abyss server
(<b>ServerCreate()</b>) using facilities of <b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b>, you
can turn it into an XML-RPC server by using the facilities described
in this section.

<p>See the <a href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html"><b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b> manual</a>
for information on the basic Abyss interface, which your program must also
use.

<h3 id="set_handlers2">xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2(TServer *         const srvP,
                                  const char *      const uriPath,
                                  xmlrpc_registry * const registryP);

</code>
</pre>

<p>This function adds to the Abyss server identified by <i>srvP</i> a
request handler for the URI path <i>uriPath</i>.  This handler
executes a POST request as an XML-RPC call as defined by the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
identified by <i>registryP</i>.  It rejects requests with other HTTP
methods for this URI path with an HTTP &quot;Method Not Allowed&quot;
(code 405) failure.

<p>&quot;URI path&quot; means the part of a Uniform Resource
Identifier known as the &quot;abs_path&quot; in the URI spec (RFC 2396).
In the example URI <tt>http://www.google.com/index.html</tt>,
<tt>/index.html</tt> is the URI path.

<p>In an HTTP POST request, the URI path becomes part of the POST
header.

<p>The customary URI path for an XML-RPC server is &quot;/RPC2&quot;.

<p>You must not call this twice for the same Abyss server.

<p>This function also adds a default request handler, which handles
requests to every URI path other than the specified.  All that handler
does is fail the request with an HTTP &quot;file not found&quot; (code
404) error.

<p>You normally call this once per server.  If you call it a second
time, it adds another handler, later in Abyss' search order, for exactly
the same requests, so it has no effect.

<p>This function was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.06 (June 2006).  With older
Xmlrpc-c, use <a
href="#set_handlers"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers()</b></a> or
<a href="#set_handler"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler()</b></a>.


<h4 id="set_handlers_example">Example</h4>

<p>This is just a fragment showing the interface to
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>.  You'd have to add a bunch
more Abyss library calls to make a complete server.

<pre>
<code>
    #include &lt;xmlrpc.h&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc_server.h&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc_server_abyss.h&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc_abyss.h&gt;

    xmlrpc_registry * registryP;
    xmlrpc_env env;
    TServer abyssServer;

    xmlrpc_env_init(&amp;env);

    registryP = xmlrpc_registry_new(&amp;env);

    xmlrpc_registry_add_method(
        &amp;env, registryP, NULL, "sample.add", &amp;sample_add, NULL);

    ServerCreate(&amp;abyssServer, "XmlRpcServer", 8080, DEFAULT_DOCS, NULL);

    xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2(&amp;abyssServer,
                                      &quot;/RPC2&quot;,
                                      registryP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>For a complete example, see the program <b>xmlrpc_loop_server</b>
in the examples directory of the Xmlrpc-c source tree.

<h3 id="set_handlers">xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers(TServer *         const srvP,
                                 xmlrpc_registry * const registryP);

</code>
</pre>

<p>This is the same as <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>
except that the URI path is always &quot;RPC2&quot;.

<p>This function exists for backward compatibility.  You should use <a
href="#set_handlers2"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b></a>
instead if possible.

<h3 id="set_handler">xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler(xmlrpc_env *      const envP,
                                TServer *         const srvP,
                                const char *      const uriPath,
                                xmlrpc_registry * const registryP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is like <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b> (note that
one is plural and other not), above, except that it does not set up a
default handler.  That means you can set up one of your own or let
Abyss' default handling (basic serving of web pages) work.

<p>You can use <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler()</b> to set up the
same default URI handler that <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>
does.

<p>Also, you can call it as many times as you want and add handlers for as
many URI paths as you want.

<p>So this gives you lower level control.

<p>One thing you can do with this function is have separate logical servers by
registering handles for multiple URI paths, each with its own method registry.
Of course, they could share a registry too.

<h4 id="set_handler_example">Example</h4>

<p>Refer to the example of <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b>
above.  The following is an example of how the last part of that example
could be different to use <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler()</b>.

<pre>
<code>

    xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler(
        &amp;env, &amp;abyssServer, &quot;/RPC3&quot;, registryP);

</code>
</pre>


<h3 id="set_handler3">xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3(
    xmlrpc_env *                              envP,
    TServer *                                 srvP,
    const xmlrpc_server_abyss_handler_parms * parmsP,
    unsigned int                              parmSize);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is like <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler()</b> above, except that
it gives you more options via lower level control.

<p>Rather than the handler executing an XML-RPC call as it sees fit, you
supply the a subroutine to execute the call.  Xmlrpc-c takes care of all the
HTTP stuff and passes the XML-RPC call (XML) to your subroutine.  You parse
the XML, interpret the XML-RPC, do the requested computation, and generate the
XML-RPC response (XML).  You can of course use Xmlrpc-c facilities to assist
in interpreting and generating the XML-RPC messages.

<p><i>parmsP</i> points to a structure containing various options.
<i>parmSize</i> is the size in bytes of that structure.  More precisely, it is
the amount of the structure that you have filled with meaningful information.
The definition of this structure is below.

<p>For <i>parmSize</i>, use the <b>XMLRPC_AHPSIZE</b> macro as in the
example.  This macro gives the size of the
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_handler_parms</b> structure up through the member you
name.  Name the last member in the structure that you set.  You must
set every member up through that one, but for every member after it,
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_hanlder3()</b> will assume a default.

<p>The reason it's important to use <b>XMLRPC_AHPSIZE</b> instead of just
setting all the members and using <b> sizeof(struct
xmlrpc_server_abyss_handler_parms)</b> is forward compatibility.  Future
versions of <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3</b> might add new members,
and you want the server program you write today, whether you compile it today
or then, to work properly with that future library.

<p>You must supply at least the <b>xml_processor</b>, <b>xml_processor_arg</b>,
and <b>xml_processor_max_stack</b> parameters.

<p>For an example of using <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3()</b>, see
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss++</b> source code.  That library uses an XML
processor that executes an XML-RPC using the C++ version of a method registry
(<b>libxmlrpc_server++</b>) rather than the C version
(<b>libxmlrpc_server</b>).

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3()</b> does not set up an Abyss default
URI handler.  So you should normally call
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler()</b> too.

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler3()</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c Release 1.25
(December 2010).  Before that, you can
use <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handler2()</b> and if you need more control
than that, you have to abandon <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> altogether and
have your own code do the things it does.

<h4 id="set_handler_parameters">Handler parameters</h4>

<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_handler_parms</b> struct, which comprises the

(June 2009).  Before that, the only way you can have your own XML processor is
to abandon <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> altogether and have your own code do
the things it does.


<h3 id="xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler">
  xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler()</h3>

<p>This function sets up an Abyss default URI handler suitable for an
XML-RPC server.  An Abyss default URI handler is the handler that handles
HTTP requests that no other handler registered with Abyss claims.

<p>Typically, you'll register one handler for a POST of URI <b>http://RPC2</b>
using one of the other <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> subroutines and no one
has any business sending any other kind of request to the server.  So the
default URI handler that <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler()</b>
registers is one that rejects the request with a 404 HTTP error response
with a message stating that the server is an XML-RPC server.

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers()</b> and
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b> register this same default URI
handler for you, so you don't need to call this subroutine too.

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_default_handler()</b> was new in 
Xmlrpc-c Release 1.19 (June 2009).

<h3 id="xmlrpc_server_abyss_run">xmlrpc_server_abyss_run()</h3>

<p>This is an old, deprecated interface.  It is a utility extension
to Abyss' <b>ServerRun()</b>.  It sets up some signal handlers and
daemonizes the process before calling <b>ServerRun()</b>.

<p>It's deprecated because this is not a healthy way to organize a
system.  Setting up signal handlers and daemonizing have nothing to do
with XML-RPC or any essential purpose of Xmlrpc-c.  Furthermore,
daemonizing should really be done by an entirely separate program.

<p>If you have an old program that uses
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run()</b> and want to update it, see <a
href="#daemonizing">Daemonizing</a> for discussion of how you should
get your program daemonized, and use plain <b>ServerRun()</b>.  Or
check out the easier <a href="#undercovers">Abyss under the covers</a>
alternative and remove all the Abyss calls from your program.

<H3 id="methodfunctionservices">Method Function Services</H3>

<p>Within an XML-RPC method function, you can get information from the
Abyss server about the circumstances of the XML-RPC call, using
certain Abyss functions.

<p><a href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html#SessionGetRequestInfo">
<b>SessionGetRequestInfo</b></a> can give you some information about
the HTTP headers that came with the call, while
<a href="libxmlrpc_abyss.html#SessionGetChannelInfo"><b>SessionGetChannelInfo()</b></a>
can tell you how the call got to you.  In particular,
<b>SessionGetChannelInfo()</b> typically tells you the IP address and TCP port
number of the HTTP client, and therefore the XML-RPC client.

<p>In order to use these Abyss services, your XML-RPC method function
must know the handle of the Abyss session that is handling the RPC.
Abyss supplies that to your method function as the <i>callInfo</i>
argument.  I.e. <i>callInfo</i> is a <b>TSession *</b>.  See <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#howto">How To Write A Method Function</a>.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    static xmlrpc_value *
    demo_noop(xmlrpc_env *   const envP, 
              xmlrpc_value * const paramArrayP,
              void *         const serverInfo,
              void *         const channelInfo) {
        
        TSession * const abyssSessionP = channelInfo;
        struct abyss_unix_chaninfo * channelInfoP;
        struct sockaddr_in * sockAddrInP;
        unsigned char * ipAddr;  /* 4 byte array */
    
        SessionGetChannelInfo(abyssSessionP, (void*)&amp;channelInfoP);
    
        sockAddrInP = (struct sockaddr_in *) &amp;channelInfoP->peerAddr;
    
        ipAddr = (unsigned char *)&amp;sockAddrInP->sin_addr.s_addr;
    
        printf(&quot;RPC is from IP address %u.%u.%u.%u\n&quot;,
               ipAddr[0], ipAddr[1], ipAddr[2], ipAddr[3]);
    
        return xmlrpc_nil_new(envP);
    }
    
    xmlrpc_registry_add_method2(
        &amp;env, registryP, &quot;demo.noop&quot;, &amp;demo_noop, NULL, NULL, NULL);
</code>
</pre>

<p>For a complete example, see the program <b>xmlrpc_loop_server</b>
in the examples directory of the Xmlrpc-c source tree.

<h2 id="undercovers">Having Abyss Under The Covers</h2>

<p>This section describes Xmlrpc-c facilities for running an Abyss
server without your program actually seeing any Abyss interfaces.
This means you don't have any flexibility in the configuration of the
Abyss server (other than that you still get to supply the
&quot;abyss.conf&quot; Abyss configuration file), but it saves you 
having to learn anything about the Abyss API.

<p>There are two versions of this facility: one that's easier to learn
and less code, and one that lets you do more.

<p>The simpler one is the anonymous server facility.  You can run a
server with a single library call (to <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>),
but because you don't get a handle for the server, you can't terminate
it from outside (i.e. from a signal handler or a separate thread).
The only way to terminate the server is have it execute an RPC that
terminates it.

<p>In the less simple version, you create a server object separately from
running it.  You have a handle for the server object, which you can use
in a signal handler or another thread to terminate the server.

<h3 id="anonymous">Anonymous Server</h3>

<p>This is the simplest way to run an XML-RPC server.  It consists of
a single library subroutine: <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>.

<h4 id="server_abyss">xmlrpc_server_abyss()</h4>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_abyss(xmlrpc_env *                const envP,
                    xmlrpc_server_abyss_parms * const parmP,
                    unsigned int                const parmSize);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This function runs an Abyss server, which functions as a complete
XML-RPC server.

<p>This is equivalent to the following sequence:

<ul>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_global_init">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_init()</b>
</a>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_create">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>

<li><a href="#server_abyss_setup_sig">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>
</a>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_run_server">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b>
</a>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_restore_sig">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig()</b>
</a>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_destroy">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_destroy()</b>
</a>
<li><a href="#server_abyss_global_term">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_term()</b>
</a>
</ul>

<p>This is designed to be run as the only thread in a process, and
owning the entire environment (e.g. not in a library).  If you want to
run an XML-RPC server as part of a larger process, you should use an
<a href="#explicit_server_abyss">explicit <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
object</a>.

<p>Example:

<p>This is just a fragment showing how to call
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>.  <a href="index.html#serverexample">This
example</a> is a complete program that uses
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>.

<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;xmlrpc.h&gt;

#include &lt;xmlrpc_server_abyss.h&gt;

    xmlrpc_server_abyss(&amp;env, &amp;serverparm, XMLRPC_APSIZE(log_file_name));

</code>
</pre>

<p>The <i>parmP</i> and <i>parmSize</i> arguments are the same as those
of <a href="#server_abyss_create"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create</b></a>.

<p><em>But:</em> note that there are two styles of providing
parameters: an old deprectaed one, and a new preferred one.  Before
Xmlrpc-c Version 1.02 (April 2005), the old style is the only one
available.

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.01.


<h3 id="explicit_server_abyss">
Explicit <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object
</h3>

<P>This is an explicit object oriented interface where you have a visible
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object.  You have access to methods of that object
that not only run the server, but terminate it as well.

<p>This entire facility (the visible <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object) was
new in Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008).  Before that, you must use
the <a href="#anonymous">anonymous server</a> facility.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>

</pre>

<p>In the example above, we assume every function succeeds, because it
makes the code easier to read.  In real life, you will want to check
the <i>env</i> variable after each function call.

<p>A buildable, working example like that above is in the Xmlrpc-c
source distribution, in the <b>examples</b> directory with the name
<b>interrupted_server</b>.


<h4 id="server_abyss_global_init"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_init()</b></h4>

<p>Example:

</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void

</code>
</pre>

<p>This is <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>'s global initialization function.

<p>See <a href="libxmlrpc.html#globalconst">Global Constants</a>
for an explanation of why you need these and how to use them.

<p>This is required only if you use explicit <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
objects.


<h4 id="server_abyss_global_term"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_term()</b></h4>

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_term();
</code>
</pre>

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_global_term(void);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>'s global termination function.

<p>See <a href="libxmlrpc.html#globalconst">Global Constants</a>
for an explanation of why you need these and how to use them.

<h4 id="server_abyss_create"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b></h4>

<P>This is a constructor for the <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object
class.  The object it creates doesn't perform any server functions by
itself; you must call its <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server</b> method
to run the server.


<p>Prototype:
<pre>
<code>
    void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_create(
        xmlrpc_env *                      const envP,
        const xmlrpc_server_abyss_parms * const parmsP,
        unsigned int                      const parmSize,
        xmlrpc_server_abyss_t **          const serverPP);
</code>
</pre>

<p>See the example above.

<p><i>envP</i> is an <a href="libxmlrpc_util.html#env">error environment
variable</a> pointer.

<p><i>parmsP</i> is a pointer to a structure that contains the
parameters of the server.  <i>parmSize</i> is the size in bytes of
that structure.  More precisely, it is the amount of the structure
that you have filled with meaningful information.  The definition of
this structure is <a href="#server_abyss_parameters">below</a>.

<p>For <i>parmSize</i>, use the <b>XMLRPC_APSIZE</b> macro as in the
example.  This macro gives the size of the
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_parms</b> structure up through the member you
name.  Name the last member in the structure that you set.  You must
set every member up through that one, but for every member after it,
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> will assume a default.

<p>The reason it's important to use <b>XMLRPC_APSIZE</b> instead of
just setting all the members and using <b> sizeof(struct
xmlrpc_server_abyss_parms)</b> is forward compatibility.  Future
versions of <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> might add new members, and
you want the server program you write today, whether you compile it
today or then, to work properly with that future library.

<p>You must supply at least the <b>config_file_name</b> parameter (just
set it to NULL) and the <b>registryP</b> parameter.  All the rest
default if your <b>parmSize</b> indicates they are not present.

<p>The function returns as *<i>serverPP</i> the handle for the newly
created server object (assuming the function succeeds).  Use this
handle as an argument to the other functions that serve as methods of
this object.


<h4 id="server_abyss_destroy"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_destroy()</b></h4>

<p>This is the object destructor.  It destroys an <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b>
object.

<p><em>Do not</em> call this while any other method is running.  That means
you cannot call it while the server is running; you must terminate the server
first, to make <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b> return.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_destroy(xmlrpc_server_abyss_t * const serverP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>serverP</i> is the handle of the object you are destroying, returned
by <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>.

<h4 id="server_abyss_run_server"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b></h4>

<p>This function runs the server.  It is the heart of your server program.

<p>The server listens on the TCP port you specified when you created
the <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object and responds to HTTP
requests (which are normally XML-RPC requests) ad infinitum.
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b> returns when <a
href="#server_abyss_term">the server terminates</a>.  It
handles multiple requests simultaneously.

<P>The server executes HTTP requests with the same handlers that
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b> installs.  See the documentation
of that function for details on how the server implements HTTP requests.
The handlers use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
you supply via <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> arguments.

<p>Because the server can execute multiple RPCs at the same time in
separate threads, it is important that the method functions in your
registry be thread safe.  If your methods have to be called serially,
use a lower level style of Abyss server where you control execution of
RPCs more directly instead.  For example, use a style in which you
create your own Abyss server object (using <b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b>) and
call the Abyss function <b>ServerRunOnce()</b> in a loop (like the
<b>xmlrpc_loop_server</b> example program in the Xmlrpc-c source
tree).

<p>Abyss' &quot;server root&quot; directory is the current directory.

<p>The function returns when the server <a
href="#server_abyss_terminate">terminates</a>.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server(xmlrpc_env *            const envP,
                                   xmlrpc_server_abyss_t * const serverP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is an <a href="libxmlrpc_util.html#env">error environment
variable</a> pointer.

<p><i>serverP</i> is the handle of the server you are running, returned
by <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>.


<h4 id="server_abyss_terminate"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b></h4>

<p>This function causes a server that is running to terminate, and to
terminate immediately if it starts running in the future.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate(xmlrpc_env *            const envP,
                                  xmlrpc_server_abyss_t * const serverP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is an <a href="libxmlrpc_util.html#env">error environment
variable</a> pointer.

<p><i>serverP</i> is the handle of the server you are terminating, returned
by <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>.

<p>Because a program that starts a server running does not regain
control as long as the server is running, this is meant to be called
from a separate thread or signal handler.

<p>If you have a signal handler that calls
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b> and the process receives a signal while
the server is running, the server will terminate
(<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b> will return) soon after the signal
handler returns.  If the server is processing an RPC when the process receives
the signal, it will not terminate until it is done with that RPC.

<p>You can also call this from an XML-RPC method function, as long as that
function is running in the same process that waits for and accepts new
connections.  If, on the other hand, you are running Abyss in a mode in which
it processes connections in the background and you have a system in which it
does that by way of a Unix fork (which is unusual in modern times), a
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b> from inside an XML-RPC method
function has no effect.

<p>If you are running the server in a mode in which it processes
connections in the background (i.e. in separate threads or processes),
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b> affects only the foreground
thread that waits for and dispatches RPCs.  Any background thread that
is executing an RPC continues normally to completion in its own time.

<p>This function was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008).  Before that,
the only way to terminate a server is to execute a
<a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#system.shutdown">
<b>system.shutdown</b></a> RPC.

<h4 id="server_abyss_reset_terminate">
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_reset_terminate()</b></h4>


<p>This function resets the termination state of a server.  While a
server is in the terminated state (as set by
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b>, it will terminate at its next
opportunity if it is running and if you run it in the future, it will
terminate immediately.  This function resets that state so that the
server will not terminate.

<p>There probably is no practical way to use this to take back a
previous termination request so that the server keeps running; it's
intended use is with a server that has already terminated (by
request), when you want to run it again.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_reset_terminate(xmlrpc_env *            const envP,
                                        xmlrpc_server_abyss_t * const serverP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is an <a href="libxmlrpc_util.html#env">error environment
variable</a> pointer.

<p><i>serverP</i> is the handle of the server you are resetting, returned
by <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>.


<h4 id="server_abyss_setup_sig"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b></h4>

<p>This function helps you set up signal handling as the
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object <a href="#signals">requires</a>.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig(
        xmlrpc_env *               const envP,
        xmlrpc_server_abyss_t *    const serverP,
        xmlrpc_server_abyss_sig ** const oldHandlersPP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is an <a href="libxmlrpc_util.html#env">error environment
variable</a> pointer.

<p><i>serverP</i> is the handle of the server you want to notify of
signal arrival, returned by <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_create()</b>.  This
object must continue to exist as long as the signal handlers are in
place, so call <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig()</b> before you
destroy it.

<p>The function returns as *<i>oldHandlersPP</i> a pointer to a
description of the state of signal handling before the call.  You
can use this later with <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig()</b>
to put it back the way it was.  This points to newly malloc'ed storage.
You must free it when you are done with it.


<h4 id="server_abyss_restore_sig"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig()</b></h4>

<p>This function restores the state of signal handling to what it was
before you called <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>.

<p>Strictly speaking, you need to make sure that the signal handling
state just before you call <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig()</b> is
the same as it was just <em>after</em> you called
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>, or you may get unexpected
results.  I.e. you need to manage signal handling state in a stack
fashion.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
<code>
    void
    xmlrpc_server_abyss_restore_sig(
        const xmlrpc_server_abyss_sig * const oldHandlersP);
</code>
</pre>

<p><i>oldHandlersP</i> is the pointer returned by your call to
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>.

<p>Set this to NULL.  That is what specifies that you're using the
preferred style instead of the deprecated <a
href="#configfile">&quot;config file&quot;</a>one.

<p>This parameter is required.

<h5 id="registryP">registryP</h5>

<p>This is a handle for a method registry.  This registry is what
determines what XML-RPC methods are defined by the server, i.e. it is
the meat of the XML-RPC server.  Use the <A
href="libxmlrpc_server.html"><b>libxmlrpc_server</b></A> library to
build a method registry appropriate for your server.  This is a
mandatory option (<i>parmSize</i> must be large enough to include
it).

<p>On a Unix system, where <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> starts the 
server in a new process, the server gets a copy of the registry, so
nothing you do to it after <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> returns affects
the server.  (On other systems, <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> never
returns, so the issue is moot).

<p>This parameter is required.

<h5 id="port_number">port_number</h5>

<p>This is the TCP port number on which the server will listen and accept
connections for RPCs.  See <a href="#server_address_parameters">Server Address
Parameters</a> for details.

<p>If you specify a reserved port number, the program must have the privilege
required to bind it (on a Unix-like system, you typically must have superuser
privilege to accept connections to a port number less than 1024).

<h5 id="socket_bound">socket_bound</h5>

<p>This boolean parameter is true (nonzero) to indicate that you are providing
an already bound stream socket on which the server is to listen for
connections from clients.  See <a href="#server_address_parameters">Server
Address Parameters</a> for details.

<p>When you specify true for <b>socket_bound</b>, you must supply a proper
value for <b>socket_fd</b>.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.04 (November 2005).  Before that,
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> always created its own socket.

<h5 id="socket_fd">socket_fd</h5>

<p>This option identifies the socket on which the server is to listen
for connections from clients (on a Unix system, it identifies it by
file descriptor).

<p>This is meaningful only when <b>socket_bound</b> is true.

<P>The socket you supply must be a stream socket, and must be bound
and ready to listen (in particular, it cannot be already listening or
connected).

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.04 (November 2005).  Before that,
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> always created its own socket.

<h5 id="sockaddr_p">sockaddr_p</h5>

<p>This option indicates the full address (e.g. IP address and TCP port
number) on which the server will listen and accept connections for RPCs.
See <a href="#server_address_parameters">Server Address Parameters</a> for
details.

<p>The value is a pointer to a conventional POSIX socket address structure.

<p>When you specify <b>sockaddr_p</b>, you must also
specify <b>sockaddrlen</b>, the size in bytes of the structure pointed to.

<p>This option also incidentally specifies the network protocol to use,
because <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> infers that from the socket address
family.  This works because it happens that every known network protocol uses
addresses of a specific family not used by any other protocol; for example
only an IP Version 4 network uses IP Version 4 network addresses.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.30 (March 2012).

<h5 id="sockaddrlen">sockaddrlen</h5>

<p>This option goes with <a href="#sockaddrlen"><b>sockaddrlen</b></a>.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.30 (March 2012).

<h5 id="uri_path">uri_path</h5>

<p>This names the URI path of the XML-RPC server.  For example, if a
client will make an XML-RPC call using the URL
&quot;http://www.google.com/RPC2&quot;, the URI path is &quot;/RPC2&quot;.
The Abyss server will process as an XML-RPC call anything POSTed to
that URI path and reject requests to any other URI path.

<p>The default (effective if this member isn't present or is NULL) is
&quot;/RPC2&quot;.

<p>For more information on what a URI path is, see <a
href="#set_handlers2"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_set_handlers2()</b></a>.

<p>This parameter was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.06 (June 2006).  Before that,
the URI path is always &quot;/RPC2&quot;.


<h5 id="max_conn">max_conn</h5>

<p>This is the maximum number of simultaneous TCP connections the server will
maintain.  When there are already this many, the server will not accept
additional TCP connections from the operating system

<p>In the simplest case, a TCP connection is an RPC, which means this is the
maximum number of clients that can simultaneously perform RPCs.  However the
client and server may agree to perform multiple RPCs on a single connection
and to facilitate that, to keep a TCP connection open in anticipation of a
future RPC.  See <a href="#keepalive_timeout"><i>keepalive_timeout</i></a>
and <a href="#keepalive_max_conn"><i>keepalive_max_conn</i></a>.

<p>While the server is not accepting connections because of this limit, the
operating system still accepts TCP connections on the server's behalf and
queues them.
See <a href="#max_conn_backlog"><i>max_conn_backlog</i></a>.

<p>A value of zero requests the default.

<p>The default is 15.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.32 (September 2012).


<h5 id="max_conn_backlog">max_conn_backlog</h5>

<p>This is the maximum number of TCP connections the operating system will
accept on the server's behalf without the server accepting them from the
operating system.  The server accepts TCP connections (presumably intended to
be RPCs) and queues them for the server to accept when it is ready.  If the
number queued reaches this limit, the operating system refuses, via the TCP
protocol, any additional connection attempts.

<p>Because the server actively executes RPCs on connections it has accepted
from the operating system, but not on those in the operating system backlog,
you can generally get better throughput with a high <i>max_conn</i> than with
a high <i>max_conn_backlog</i>.  But if your server is overloaded, having too
many RPCs executing at once can cause thrashing, in which case a
lower <i>max_conn</i> improves performance and a high <i>max_conn_backlog</i>
makes sure you don't lose RPCs.  But note that <i>max_conn_backlog</i> is
effective only at accomodating bursts of RPCs.  If the RPCs arrive at a
sustained rate higher than the server can handle, a larger queue only hurts.

<p>A value of zero requests the default.

<p>The default is 15.

<p>This option was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.32 (September 2012).


<h5 id="keepalive_timeout">keepalive_timeout</h5>

<p>After the server has received an XML-RPC call and sent the response,
it keeps the HTTP connection open for a while so that the client may
send another XML-RPC call without starting up a new connection, thus
saving time and resources.

<p>This parameter is the maximum time in seconds that the server
allows a connection to be open between RPCs.  If the client does not
send another call or close the connection within this period, the
server closes the connection.

<p>This is also the maximum time the server allows a connection to be open
before the first data arrives from the client.  If a client connects and then
doesn't start sending HTTP headers soon enough, it sees the connection close.

<p>A value of zero requests the default.

<p>The default is 15 seconds.


<h5 id="keepalive_max_conn">keepalive_max_conn</h5>

<p>This is the maximum number of RPCs that the server will execute on
a single connection.  Once the server has responded to this many, it
closes the connection and the client must create a new connection to
do any more.

<p>A value of zero requests the default.

<p>The default is 30.


<h5 id="timeout">timeout</h5>

<p>This is the maximum time in seconds the server will wait for the client
to do anything while processing an RPC.  This does not apply to waiting
between RPCs (see <a href="#keepalive_timeout">keepalive_timeout</a>).

<p>A value of zero requests the default.

<p>The default is 15 seconds.

<h5 id="enable_shutdown">enable_shutdown</h5>

<P>This logical value says that the server should shut down when a client
executes a <b>system.shutdown</b> system method.

<p>The default is false, so that a <b>system.shutdown</b> call always
fails, with a fault string indicating that there is no way to shut down
this server.

<p>If you set this to true, any client that can execute an RPC on this
server can shut it down.

<p>Note that if you use a lower level interface (not
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>), in which you supply your own Abyss
server, your program can decide whether to comply with a
<a href="libxmlrpc_server.html#system.shutdown">
<b>system.shutdown</b></a> request.  It might do it based on the IP
address of the client, for example.  But with
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>, your only choices are
<b>system.shutdown</b> for everybody or
<b>system.shutdown</b> for nobody.

<p>If you create a <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> with a registry in which
you have set a shutdown function, that setting has no effect.  The
shutdown function does not get called.

<p>This parameter did not exist before Xmlrpc-c 1.07 (October 2006).
Before that, <b>system.shutdown</b> never succeeds.

<h5 id="dont_advertise">dont_advertise</h5>

<P>The server has a feature wherein it can tell querents things about
itself, such as what methods is knows.  The feature is called
&quot;introspection.&quot; See <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#systemmethod">System Methods</a>.  By
default, the feature is available, but if you set
<b>dont_advertise</b> to nonzero, it isn't.  In that case, the
introspection methods do not exist to a client.

<p>Supplying the information for introspection is a separate matter.
If you allow introspection, but don't supply any information when you
create your registry, the client can execute the method, but won't get
any information.  Similarly, if you supply introspection method, but
set <b>dont_advertise</b> true, the information you supplied will be
useless.

<h5 id="chunk_response">chunk_response</h5>

<p>This logical value says that the server should chunk responses, in
the HTTP sense, if possible.  By default, the server never chunks a
response.

<p>Chunking is an HTTP concept in which the HTTP server sends a response
in pieces, each piece preceded by an indication of its size.  When an
HTTP server sends a chunked response, it doesn't have to say at the 
beginning of the response how big the whole response is.  So it might
compute the response as it sends it, not knowing until it reaches the
end how big it is.

<p>While this function makes the server chunk the response, the server
in all cases includes the required content-length header, per XML-RPC.

<p>When you use this option, the server is not a legal XML-RPC server.
That's because an XML-RPC server must be an HTTP server and also
include a content-length header in every response, but an HTTP server
cannot include a content-length header in a chunked response.

<p>It's hard to see how chunking could be useful in XML-RPC, because
not only is a response usually pretty small, but the XML-RPC standard
requires a content-length header at the beginning of the response that
gives the whole response's size.  And of course, being nonstandard
XML-RPC, the client might not be able to handle it.  (An Xmlrpc-c
client can, though).

<p>This parameter was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.06 (June 2006).  In Xmlrpc-c 1.05, the
response is never chunked, and before that sometimes it is and sometimes it
isn't, folowing a strange and inexplicable policy partly based on whether the
server is keeping alive the connection.

<h5 id="allow_origin">allow_origin</h5>

<p>This option is part of HTTP access control, which is a feature that helps
with the security exposure of cross-site scripting.  This is the problem where
a user on network node C browses a web site on server S and S sends a script
for C to execute.  The script says to perform as RPC on Xmlrpc-c server X.
The Xmlrpc-c server may accord that request special privilege because it comes
from C, without knowing that the user at C doesn't really know he's making the
request.  To solve this problem, the browser on C may just refuse to honor any
requests in any script to perform an RPC anywhere, but this also shuts out
legitimate scripting.  So HTTP provides the browser on C a way to ask X if it
would be OK to perform an RPC from a third party and if X says there's no
cross-scripting security exposure if it does, then and only then the client
honors the request from S's script to perform an RPC on X.

<p>If you don't specify <b>allow_origin</b> or specify it as a null pointer,
the Abyss server, when asked, refuses to OK any cross-scripting.
Specifically, it does not include any of the HTTP access control header fields
in its response to an HTTP Options method request (or any other request).

<p>If you specify non-null <b>allow_origin</b>, the server includes an
Access-Control-Allow-Origin field in its responses.  The value of the
parameter is the verbatim value for the HTTP header field value, so look at
HTTP specifications for details.  Briefly, it is a list of third party servers
whose scripts the client should trust to perform RPCs on this server.  The
most useful value is &quot;*&quot;, which means all third party servers.

<p>This parameter was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010).  Before that,
the server fails any attempt to get option information, responding with
a 405 Method Not Allowed error to any Options request and never includes
HTTP access control header fields in any other response.

<h5 id="access_control_expires">access_control_expires</h5>

<p>This option is part of HTTP access control and has effect only when
<b>allow_origin</b> is non-null.

<p>The option value is logical and indicates that the permissions the server
gives for third party RPCs expires after a certain time -- the client should
request permission again if it wants to perform third party RPCs after that.
If the value is true, the Abyss server includes in its response to an HTTP
request an Access-Control-Max-Age header field.  Otherwise, the server does
not include such a header field.

<p><b>access_control_max_age</b> controls the expiration period.

<p>Default is false.

<p>This parameter was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010) along with all
HTTP access control participation.

<h5 id="access_control_max_age">access_control_max_age</h5>

<p>This option is part of HTTP access control and has effect only when
<b>allow_origin</b> is non-null.

<p>This option is meaningless when <b>access_control_expires</b> is false.

<p>The value of this option is the time in seconds that permissions the server
gives out are good.  The server includes this information in its
Access-Control-Max-Age HTTP header field in response to an HTTP request.

<p>This parameter was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010) along with all
HTTP access control participation.


<h5 id="log_file_name">log_file_name</h5>

<p>This names the file that Abyss will use for a log file.  If this
member isn't present (according to <i>parmSize</i>) or is null, Abyss
won't have a log file.


<h5 id="runfirst">runfirst, runfirst_arg</h5>

<p>These are meaningless (they're for the <a href="#configfile">config
file style interface</a>).



<h3 id="server_address_parameters">Server Address Parameters</h3>

<p><b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> gives you various ways to determine what
the address of your server will be, i.e. on what IP address and TCP port it
will listen for connections from clients.  You choose one via 
<a href="#server_abyss_parameters">server parameters</a>.

<p>The server listens continually for connections attempted to the given
address, which causes the operating system to accept connections (up to some
limit) and queue them.  When you subsequently call the relevant methods, the
server processes those connections.

<p>Note that all the server parameters we mention here are optional; when
you create a server object, you say how long your server parameter structure
is and that determines which parameters you have specified.

<p>In the simplest method, you specify nothing in the parameters, and the
server defaults to listening on all IP Version 4 network interfaces (i.e. as
every IP Version 4 address the system has), TCP Port 8080.

<p>If you don't want to use Port 8080, specify a different port number with
the <a href="#port_number"><b>port_number</b></a> server parameter.  A zero
value is the same as not specifying the parameter; there is no way to specify
Port 0.

<p>If you want to limit your server to one IP address (one network interface)
or put it on an IP Version 6 network, specify a <b>sockaddr_p</b> parameter.
Its value indicates a conventional POSIX socket address structure.  You
must always accompany a <b>sockaddr_p</b> parameter with <b>sockaddrlen</b>.

<p>This is a tricky data structure and we won't go into detail on how to use
it here because that trickiness is not specific to Xmlrpc-c.  If you know how
to code a program using a POSIX <b>bind()</b> call, you can code one using
<b>sockaddr_p</b> and <b>sockaddrlen</b>.

<p>When you specify <b>sockaddr_p</b>, any <b>port_number</b> parameter you
specify is meaningless.

<p>A null pointer for <b>sockaddr_p</b> is the same as not specifying it.

<p>Finally, you can take the choice of address out
of <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>'s hands completely and just supply a POSIX
socket of your own, which is already bound to the desired address.  To do
that, specify the file descriptor of the socket with a <b>socket_fd</b>
parameter and specify the <b>socket_bound</b> server parameter flag.

<p>One reason you would want to supply a socket, as opposed to just letting
the server create one, is that you want the server to listen on a reserved port
and don't want your program to have the privilege necessary to bind a reserved
port.  In that case, you can have a privileged program bind the port, drop
privileges, and then run your program.

<p>When you specify <b>socket_bound</b>, any <b>sockaddr_p</b> or
<b>port_number</b> parameter you specify is meaningless.


<h3 id="server_abyss_term">Server Termination</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> or
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b> returns when the server
terminates.  The server terminates when it executes an RPC of the
<b>system.shutdown</b> <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#systemmethod">system method</a> or when
you call the <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object's <a
href="#server_abyss_terminate"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b></a>
method.

<p>For more information on using <b>system.shutdown</b>, see the <a
href="#enable_shutdown"><i>enable_shutdown</i></a> server parameter.

<p><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_terminate()</b> is usable only when you use an
explicit <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_t</b> object, which became possible in
Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008).

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.06 (June 2006), the server does not implement
<b>system.shutdown</b> and there is no way to shut down the server, so
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> never returns (except if it fails to
start the server at all).  And before Xmlrpc-c 1.14 (March 2008),
<b>system.shutdown</b> can't actually interrupt anything the server is
doing -- the server won't notice it is supposed to terminate as long
as it is asleep waiting for an RPC.  So you normally have to call it
twice -- once to request shutdown, and once to wake up the master
thread so it notices the request.

<p>The same is true on Windows until Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010).


<h3 id="signals">Signals</h3>

<p>There are some signals that affect the proper operation of an Abyss
server.  Because signals are process-global entities,
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> cannot take care of these for you.
However, the library does provide convenience functions that do what
most programs want and saves you a lot of work.

<p>One important class of signals is SIGPIPE.  By default, a Unix
operating system sends a SIGPIPE signal to your process when it
attempts to write to a socket that has been closed from the other end.
By default, that signal then causes the OS to terminate your process.
Writing to sockets is how an Abyss server sends responses to clients,
so this means if a client hangs up on you, you die.  Therefore, you
almost certainly want to tell the OS not to send these signals.  The
way you do that is rather messy: you call a system function that
ostensibly tells the OS to ignore signals of class SIGPIPE, but it
really tells the OS to handle closed sockets in a whole different
way that doesn't involve signals.

<p><a
href="#server_abyss_setup_sig"><b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b></a> does
that.

<p>Another important class is SIGCHLD.  Some versions of
<b>libxmlrpc_abyss</b> generate servers that fork a new process to handle each
HTTP request.  This is not the usual way (normally, it uses POSIX or Windows
threads), but some systems need it.  On such a system, when one of these
processes dies, the OS sends a SIGCHLD signal to the Abyss dispatcher process,
which is the process from which you called
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_run_server()</b>.

<p>Abyss generally needs to know that this signal arrived, so (if you have a
forking Abyss) you need to set up a signal handler for SIGCHLD signals and
have it call <b>ServerHandleSigchld()</b>.  You also must call
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_use_sigchld()</b> before you run the Abyss server to
declare that your program intends to deliver those signals thusly.  If you
don't have the signal handler, and therefore don't call
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_use_sigchld()</b>, Abyss will make do with polling
occasionally to see who is still alive.  This hurts performance and resource
usage, so you should work that way only if signals just don't work in your
environment.

<p>The SIGCHLD handler must reap the dead child; that's not part of
<b>ServerHandleSigchld()</b>'s responsibilities.

<p>Note that it's OK to pass <em>all</em> the SIGCHLD signals to
Abyss, whether they are for an Abyss child or not.  Abyss ignores SIGCHLD
signals from a processes that don't belong to it.

<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b> takes care of all that for you.

<p>Bear in mind that signal behavior is global.  What you set up for the
benefit of Abyss may affect non-Abyss code in the same process.

<p>There is no such thing as a signal on Windows, so you don't need to
worry about them.  On Windows, <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>
does nothing.

<p>But <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b> is not for everyone.  If
your process receives SIGCHLD signals that don't belong to Abyss, and
needs to see them, you can't use <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss_setup_sig()</b>
because it would swallow up all SIGCHLD signals.  You must set up your
own signal handlers as described above in that case.


<h3 id="daemonizing">Daemonizing</h3>

<p>You probably want your XML-RPC server to run as a daemon, quite
independent of the process that started it running.
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> does nothing to separate the server from
the process that invoked it, so you'll want to take care of that
before calling it.  In fact, while it's customary for Unix server
programs to daemonize themselves, it's actually a lot more sensible
for the entire server program to be oblivious to its process context.
A separate program should create the daemon and have it execute the
server program.

<p>Whether you use a separate general purpose daemon program to launch
your XML-RPC server program or you have your XML-RPC server program
daemonize itself before calling <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>, here are
some things you should think about resetting for the server:

<ul>
<li>set real and effective userids and group ids
<li>reduce process privileges (e.g. Linux capabilities)
<li>make a new process
<li>make a new process group and session
<li>close open files (e.g. Standard Input/Output/Error)
<li>change current directory
<li>clear environment variables
<li>disassociate the controlling terminal
</ul>


<h3 id="configfile">Deprecated &quot;config file&quot; Style Interface</h3>

<p>The deprecated style is higher level than the preferred one.
You supply an Abyss configuration file and the library routine parses
it for parameters, forks a new process, and sets up the process
environment for the Abyss server (including for example setting the
userid) in addition to actually executing the server.  

<p>The preferred style is down at the level that a program that uses
the <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> API probably is.  You supply all
parameters in data structures in memory.  The library function runs
the Abyss server, but expects you to have set up the process
environment beforehand.

<p>You choose the deprecated style by setting <i>config_file_name</i>
in the parameter structure to non-null.

<p>On Unix, <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> creates a new process for the
server, separated in the usual ways from the process that created it
so that it can continue as an independent process.  (This separation
is sometimes called &quot;backgrounding&quot; or
&quot;daemonizing&quot;).  <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> returns after
starting the server, and your program can then exit.  On other
platforms, this function performs the server functions itself, and
never returns.

<p><i>config_file_name</i> is the filename of an Abyss configuration
file.  Use Abyss documentation to learn the full format of this file.
Here is an example of a working Abyss configuration file we have used
in examples:
<pre>
Port 8080
LogFile /tmp/xmlrpc_abyss.log
PidFile /tmp/abyss.pid
</pre>

<p><i>runfirst</i> is a function that <b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b>
runs in the server process before starting the Abyss server.  You can
use this to set up the server process in ways that you can't from the
parent process.  <i>runfirst_arg</i> is an argument (opaque to
Xmlrpc-c) that gets passed to <i>runfirst</i>.

<p>The runfirst function is a convenient way to add to the function of
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>, but if you have a program sophisticated
enough to need it, you might find you really need to assume the job of
building the server process yourself and not use
<b>xmlrpc_server_abyss()</b> at all.  This style of server is
described <a href="#ownabyss">here</a>.

<h3 id="wireprotocol">Wire Protocol</h3>

<p>This section gives some information on the protocol that the XML-RPC
server follows in its communication with clients.

<p>The most basic fact is, of course, that the protocol is XML-RPC.  However,
that protocol is ambiguous in a number of ways, so more needs to be said.
Also, Xmlrpc-c deviates in some ways where you are better off not following
the XML-RPC spec verbatim.

<p>In addition to what is stated here, a server you build using
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> employs protocol interpretations and
deviations implemented by <a href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b></a>,
because <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> uses <b>libxmlrpc</b>.   For example,
the meaning of the various data types and extensions for types such as
64 bit integer is determined by <b>libxmlrpc</b> .


<h4 id="contenttype">HTTP Content Type</h4>

<p>In HTTP, a document (request or response) has a &quot;content type,&quot;
which it declares with a <b>content-type</b> HTTP header field.  In XML-RPC,
that content type is <b>text/xml</b>, and must be declared.

<p>But <b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> doesn't pay any attention to content type
in calls it receives.  It assumes the content is an XML-RPC call, which in
HTTP terms implies it is <b>text/xml</b>, regardless of what
the <b>content-type</b> header field says, or if it is present at all.  This
way, an incorrectly implemented client (and we have seen one, which declares
content type <b>text/plain</b>) will work.

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.25 (December 2010), the server fails any call that
does not declare a content type of <b>text/xml</b>.


<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<p>This section contains special topics of interest to users of the
facilities described above.


<h3 id="httpauth">HTTP Authentication</h3>

<P>HTTP authentication is the concept of the XML-RPC client, as an
HTTP client, identifying and authenticating itself to the XML-RPC server,
as an HTTP server, using features of the HTTP protocol.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b> provides no facilities for doing any of that.

<p>This is a typical drawback of using the simple Abyss server.  The world of
HTTP is much larger than Abyss knows or could be expected to know in future
verisons.  For this reason, many people use a plugin to a more serious HTTP
server (like Apache) to do XML-RPC serving.  Xmlrpc-c does provide some
facilities that are useful for creating or working with such a plugin.
<a href="libxmlrpc_server_cgi.html"><b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b></a> helps you
make an XML-RPC server out of CGI
programs.  <a href="libxmlrpc_server.html"><b>libxmlrpc_server</b></a>
contains method registry
services.  <a href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc.html</b></a> provides
facilities for parsing and generating the XML for XML-RPC calls and responses.


<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>The trace facilities described here write messages to the Standard
Error file descriptor via the Standard Error stream of the standard C
library (<b>stderr</b>).  So make sure you have one.  Many server
processes don't (they explicitly close the one that the system setup
code provides).

<p>If you set the <b>XMLRPC_TRACE_ABYSS</b> environment variable to 1,
<b>libxmlrpc_server_abyss</b>'s Abyss request handler prints a message
to Standard Error each time Abyss calls it.

<p>You can also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a>
environment variable to trace the handler's calls to the
<b>libxmlrpc_server</b> registry.

<p>Set Abyss' <b>ABYSS_TRACE_CONN</b> environment variable to 1 to
cause Abyss to print to Standard Error the raw HTTP requests 
and responses.
(New in Xmlrpc-c 1.03, June 2005, for requests only; responses added
in Xmlrpc-c 1.05 (March 2006)).

<p>If you need even lower level tracing, Abyss'
<b>ABYSS_TRACE_SOCKET</b> environment variable traces the individual
socket service calls (e.g.  shows you the data returned by a call to
the Unix C library'es recv() function).
