<h1>libxmlrpc_util</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the <b>libxmlrpc_util</b>
function library, which is part of XML-RPC For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also
see <a href="libgeneral.html">General Library Information - C</a>.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_util</b> provides utilities not specifically related
to XML-RPC.  But the libraries of Xmlrpc-c use these facilities, so you
need them to use the XML-RPC-specific libraries.  <b>libxmlrpc_util</b> also
contains some functions that are not documented for use outside of
Xmlrpc-c, but rather are intended to be called only by other Xmlrpc-c code.
<b>libxmlrpc_util</b> is a prerequisite of most other Xmlrpc-c libraries,
which means you must link it with any program that you link with those other
libraries.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/util.h&gt;</B> header file declares the interface
to <b>libxmlrpc_util</b> and many other things described in this chapter.

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it.  Or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the <b>libxmlrpc_util</b>
library is <b>libxmlrpc_util.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_util.so</b>.  The classic
linker option to cause the library to be linked into your program is
<tt>-l xmlrpc_util</tt>.  These are hints; you'll have to modify this
according to conventions of your particular platform.  You'll also
have to figure out where the library resides and how to make your
linker look there for it.  Or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.

<p><b>libxmlrpc_util</b> has no prerequisites to link.


<h2 id="assert">Assertions</h2>

<p>Xmlrpc-c provides some macros and functions for making assertions
of various things.  Like the C library <b>assert()</b> function, these
generate runtime assertion checking code as described above.  But also
like the <b>assert()</b> function, they <em>don't</em> generate the
assertion checking code if you compile with the <b>NDEBUG</b> macro defined,
as with a <b>-DNDEBUG</b> compiler option.

<p>The concept of assertions in code is widely misunderstood, because it
is somewhat more abstract than C coders are used to.  An assertion is a
statement in code that declares a certain fact to be true.  It doesn't
make it true; it just declares that the coder knows it is true.  In a standard
C library, the <b>assert()</b> function performs this duty.

<p>But what does the statement cause the computer to <em>do</em>?  If
you're a high level coder, that's none of your business.  You write
code to describe the solution to a computational problem, and how the
computer manipulates itself to compute the solution is beyond your
concern.  Your audience is the human reading your code.

<p>So the most basic function of an assertion is to help the reader read
the code.  You assert that the value of variable <b>foo</b> is not zero,
and that helps the reader see that it won't cause a problem to divide by
it.

<p>Another practical effect of an assertion could be that the compiler
generates more efficient code with the additional information from your
higher intelligence about how the program works.  But I've never seen any
actual compiler capable of that.

<p>An assertion might also help the compiler to point out bugs in your
program.  You assert that the value of <b>foo</b> is zero, but you
never initialized <b>foo</b>, so you obviously didn't write the program
you thought you did.  But I've never seen a compiler with that capability
either.

<p>Finally, there is run time checking of the assertion.  This one is
real.  At run time, the program checks that the condition asserted
really is true.  If it isn't, which means the program is broken, it
crashes itself.  The advantages of this are twofold: 1) this makes it
easier to diagnose the bug; 2) it stops the broken program from going on
to damage something.

<p>People often have trouble seeing the abstract meaning of an
assertion and simply see it as a statement that tells the computer,
&quot;crash if X is not true.&quot; But in fact, it's quite the
opposite: It says, &quot;I assure you X <em>is</em> true.&quot;

<p>People sometimes get the idea that assertion statements are for
error checking.  That is definitely not what they are for.  If there
is a possibility that X is false when the program is working
as designed, you should not assert that X is true.  Instead, check the
truth of X and if it's false, issue an error message or exit the
program or return with a failure return code, or something like that.

<p>Incidentally, a common way you know something is true inside a
subroutine is that you required as an entry condition to the
subroutine that the caller make sure it is true.  A subroutine assumes
that it's entry conditions are met, so if you set up the requirement
that the caller pass only positive values for parameter X, you may
legitimately assert inside the subroutine that X is positive.  In
fact, that assertion is a good formal way to state that entry
condition for the reader of the code.

<p>You can use <b>XMLRPC_ASSERT_PTR_OK()</b> to <a
href="#assert">assert</a> that a pointer is a valid pointer and not a
null pointer.


<h2 id="errorhandling">Error Handling</h2>

<p>Xmlrpc-c provides facilities for handling errors.  The Xmlrpc-c
functions use them, and you can use them in your own code.  

<h3 id="example_errorhandling">Example</h3>

<p>Here is an example of how to use these facilities:

<pre>
<code>
    xmlrpc_env env;

    xmlrpc_env_init(&amp;env);

    xmlrpc_do_something(&amp;env);
    if (env.fault_occurred)
        report_error_appropriately();

    xmlrpc_env_clean(&amp;env);

</code>
</pre>


<h3 id="env">Error Environment Variable</h3>

<p>XML-RPC defines a &quot;fault structure.&quot; It is represented in
the protocol by a &lt;fault&gt; XML element.  In an XML-RPC response,
it describes how a request failed, with a fault code and and a fault
string.  The fault code is supposed to be an integer from a small set
agreed upon by the client and server and describe the general nature
of the failure, while the fault string describes the failure in text,
in a form typically suitable only for presenting to a human user.  The
fault string is whatever the server thinks best makes the point; there
are no constraints on it.

<p>Because an error detected in a server often turns into an error
response to the client, and an error reported in a client is often
what was reported in an error response from the server, Xmlrpc-c
represents errors the same way as the XML-RPC fault structure.  That
makes it easy to pass the error information around.

<p>Xmlrpc-c error handling facilities are based on an &quot;error
environment&quot; variable (not to be confused with a Unix process
&quot;environment variable&quot; -- we're talking about a C variable).
An error environment variable has type <b>xmlrpc_env</b>.  You pass
one into a function which might recognize an error and fail.  The
function sets in the error environment variable whether or not it
failed, and if it did, information about the failure analogous to an
XML-RPC fault structure.  If the failure has nothing to do with an
XML-RPC request failing, the fault code is always
<b>XMLRPC_INTERNAL_ERROR</b>.

<p>I would like to point out that discrete error codes such as XML-RPC
fault codes and the classic C integer return code, are archaic -- They
come from an era when a couple of bytes was all a program could spare
for describing an error.  They have the apparent advantage of being
machine-friendly, but in practice people almost never write code to
check the value of a discrete error code.  The code at best checks
whether a function succeeded or failed, and any more specific
information than that just gets passed up to a human.

<p>Moreover, if the fact of a particular kind of failure is informative
enough that a program can take a particular action because of it, then
the user ought to be able to get that information from a successful RPC
instead of by analyzing the failure of one.  For example, it is better
to have a means of querying explicitly whether a file named <b>foo</b> exists
that to have the user attempt to access the file and recognize a
special fault for &quot;file doesn't exist.&quot;

<p>Therefore, I recommend you pay little attention to Xmlrpc-c's fault
codes and instead treat the fault string as the primary error
indication.  Don't be stingy in your fault strings -- it doesn't cost
you anything to return 25 words of error information and it might save
the user a lot of diagnosis time.  Break with the Unix tradition of
providing at most 3 words of information about any failure.  When a
subroutine you call fails, include the subroutine's fault string plus
information about the context in which you called it in the fault
string you return to your caller.

<h3 id="usingenv">Using Error Environment Variables</h3>

<p>It is possible for a variable of type <b>xmlrpc_env</b> to be
invalid.  To assert that this is not the case, use
<b>ASSERT_ENV_OK()</b>.  

<p>Before passing an error environment variable to anything, you must
initialize it with <b>xmlrpc_env_init()</b>.  This sets the environment
variable to a valid state that indicates no error has occurred.

<p>When you are done with an error environment variable, you must declare
such by calling <b>xmlrpc_env_clean()</b> on it.  After that, you cannot
use it again unless you run <b>xmlrpc_env_init()</b> on it again.

<p>To set an error environment variable to indicate an error has
occurred, use <b>xmlrpc_env_set_fault()</b>.  The arguments to that
are a fault code and a fault string.  Or use
<b>xmlrpc_env_set_fault_formatted()</b>, which is the same except in
place of the fault string argument, you have a printf-style format
string followed by printf-style substitution arguments.  Or use
<b>xmlrpc_faultf()</b>, which is the same as
<b>xmlrpc_env_set_fault_formatted()</b> except that the fault code is
always <B>XMLRPC_INTERNAL_ERROR</B> (and its name is shorter!).

<p>In any function call to build an error environment variable, you supply the
fault string as a
NUL-terminated <a href="libgeneral.html#characterencoding">UTF-8</a> string of
XML characters.  (If you aren't familiar with UTF-8, just use ASCII, because
that meets the UTF-8 requirement.  XML characters are everything but the ASCII
control characters, plus CR, LF, and Tab).  If your argument is not valid
UTF-8 XML characters, the function edits it in arbitrary ways to make a string
that is.

<p>These are the defined fault codes and for each, the integer to
which it maps should it find its way into an XML-RPC fault
structure.  The fault code names are defined C identifiers.

<table summary="fault codes">
<tr><th><td>Fault code name                 <td>XML-RPC code
<tr><td>XMLRPC_INTERNAL_ERROR               <td>-500
<tr><td>XMLRPC_TYPE_ERROR                   <td>-501
<tr><td>XMLRPC_INDEX_ERROR                  <td>-502
<tr><td>XMLRPC_PARSE_ERROR                  <td>-503
<tr><td>XMLRPC_NETWORK_ERROR                <td>-504
<tr><td>XMLRPC_TIMEOUT_ERROR                <td>-505
<tr><td>XMLRPC_NO_SUCH_METHOD_ERROR         <td>-506
<tr><td>XMLRPC_REQUEST_REFUSED_ERROR        <td>-507
<tr><td>XMLRPC_INTROSPECTION_DISABLED_ERROR <td>-508
<tr><td>XMLRPC_LIMIT_EXCEEDED_ERROR         <td>-509
<tr><td>XMLRPC_INVALID_UTF8_ERROR           <td>-510
</table>

<p>The XML-RPC specification does not specify the meaning of any fault
codes -- it says that is up to the particular client and server or
some higher standard to specify.  Xmlrpc-c is one such higher
standard, as expressed above.  I don't know if those fault code
values are used by any servers and clients other than those that use
Xmlrpc-c.

<p>Note that Xmlrpc-c does <em>not</em> conform to any part of the <a
href="http://xmlrpc-epi.sourceforge.net/specs/rfc.fault_codes.php">Fault Code
Interoperability standard</a>.

<p>To determine whether an error environment variable indicates a
failure or not, just look at the <b>fault_occurred</b> member of the C
struct which is type <b>xmlrpc_env</b>.  (This is uncharacteristically
primitive and un-object-oriented.  There really should be a
<b>fault_occurred()</b> function (method) for querying this).

<p>You must ensure that what you pass to a subroutine as an error
environment variable is valid and that anything that is passed to you
as an environment variable is valid when you return.  Conversely, you
may assume that anything passed or returned to you as an error
environment variable is valid.  Bear in mind that the functions that
manage error environment variables may have an argument that is an
error environment variable, but not <em>the</em> error environment
variable.  E.g. the argument to <b>xmlrpc_env_init()</b> is an
environment variable, but its purpose isn't to return error
information, and obviously, you aren't required to ensure it is valid
before the call.

<h3 id="throwerror">Throwing Errors</h3>

<p>Xmlrpc-c provides facilities, based on error environment variables,
for doing bailout style error handling -- basically, a goto around all
the normal code wherever you detect that something's gone horribly
wrong.  This mimics what some modern object oriented languages do, but
since C does not have the infrastructure that those have (mainly,
automatic destructors of objects), it basically is just an ugly goto,
with all the associated unreadability and opportunity for coding
error.

<p>If you like high level code, don't use these facilities.

<p><B>XMLRPC_FAIL()</B> sets the specified environment variable to
indicate a failure, with the indicated fault code and fault string,
and then branches to the label <b>cleanup</b>.  You must provide a
label <b>cleanup</b> that undoes anything your subroutine might have
done and returns from your subroutine.

<p>Example:

<pre>
<code>
static void
mysubroutine(void) {
  mymem = malloc(80);

  rc = open(&quot;myfile&quot;, 0);
  if (rc &lt; 0)
    XMLRPC_FAIL(&amp;env, XMLRPC_INTERNAL_ERROR, &quot;couldn't open the file&quot;);

  process the file ...


cleanup:
  free(mymem);
}

</code>
</pre>

<p>We call what <b>XMLRPC_FAIL</b> does &quot;throwing an error.&quot;

<p><b>XMLRPC_FAIL1()</b> is the same as <b>XMLRPC_FAIL()</b>, except that
instead of the fault string, you give it a printf-style format string that
contains 1 substitution and an argument for that substitution.

<p><b>XMLRPC_FAIL2</b> is the same except with 2 substitutions, and
<B>XMLRPC_FAIL3</B> is the same except with 3 substitutions.

<p><B>XMLRPC_FAIL_IF_NULL()</B> is the same as <b>XMLRPC_FAIL()</b>
except that you also pass it a pointer, and it throws an error only if
that pointer is null; otherwise, it does nothing.

<p><b>XMLRPC_FAIL_IF_FAULT()</b> checks the error environment variable
you supply and if it indicates no error, does nothing.  If it does
indicate an error, <B>XMLRPC_FAIL_IF_FAULT()</B> throws an error.


<h2 id="fatalerror">Fatal Error Handling</h2>

<p>The utilities in this section have nothing particular to do with
Xmlrpc-c.  They're just conveniences for any C programmer.

<p><b>XMLRPC_FATAL_ERROR()</b> issues a message containing the indicated
string and the location in the program that you called it, if possible.
Use this where you detect a bug in your program.


<h2 id="memoryblock">Memory Blocks</h2>

<p>Xmlrpc-c provides a data type for managing blocks of memory.  Xmlrpc-c
uses such blocks of memory in some of its interfaces, and you may find it
convenient to use for your own purposes too.

<p>The basic object is a &quot;memory block.&quot; A memory block is
essentially an array whose size you can change at will.  The array
elements can be of any type (e.g. an array of characters, an array of
integers, an array of <b>struct foo</b>).

Here's an example:

<pre>
<code>
#include &lt;xmlrpc.h&gt;;

struct mystruct {
    time_t measurementTime;
    int measurement;
    bool reported;
}
struct mystruct * myArray;
xmlrpc_mem_block * myMemBlockP;

myMemBlockP = XMLRPC_TYPE_MEM_BLOCK_NEW(struct mystruct, &amp;env, 0);

for (i = 0; i &lt; 5; ++i) {
    struct mystruct newMeasurement;
    newMeasurement.time        = time(NULL);
    newMeasurement.measurement = currentMeasurement();
    newMeasurement.reported    = FALSE;

    XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_APPEND(struct mystruct, &amp;env,
                                  &amp;myMemBlockP, 
                                  &amp;newMeasurement, 1);
}
myArray = XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_CONTENTS(struct mystruct, myMemBlockP);

printf(&quot;the 3rd measurement was %d\n&quot;, myArray[2]);

myArray[2].reported = TRUE;

...

XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_FREE(struct mystruct, &amp;myMemBlockP);

</code>
</pre>

<p><b>xmlrpc_mem_block</b> is the type of a memory block.  This one
type is used for all memory blocks regardless of the element type, and
you must indicate on every call to the memory block manipulation
functions what the type is.


<p>To create a memory block, use <b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_NEW()</b>.  To
destroy one, use <b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_FREE()</b>.


<p>To find out the current size (number of elements) of a memory block, use
<b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_SIZE()</b>.  To change the current size
(to any number of elements), use <b>XMLRPC_TYPE_MEM_BLOCK_RESIZE()</b>.

<P>To access and update the contents of a memory block, use
<b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_CONTENTS()</b> to get a pointer that you
can use as a C array.  (See above example).

<p>Another way to set the contents of the memory block is to use
<b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_APPEND()</b> to increase the size of the array
by one and set the added element to the value you specify.


<p><b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_INIT()</b> and
<b>XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_CLEAN()</b> are like the create and destroy
functions, but you supply the storage for the <b>xmlrpc_mem_block</b>.
Example:

<pre>
<code>
static void
myFunction(void) {
    xmlrpc_env env;
    xmlrpc_mem_block myMemBlock;

    XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_INIT(unsigned int, &amp;env, &amp;myMemBlock, 5);
    -- use myMemBlock --
    XMLRPC_TYPED_MEM_BLOCK_CLEAN(unsigned int, &amp;myMemBlock);
}

</code>
</pre>


<h2 id="base64">Base64 Encoding And Decoding</h2>

<p>These are functions to encode byte strings into base64 and decode base64.

<p>Base64 is a code that can represent an arbitrary string of bytes
as a string of printable characters.  The base64 code uses only the 
64 printable characters from the ASCII code.  These routines encode those
characters as ASCII.  The encodings are therefore necessarily UTF-8
Unicode as well.

<p>In the XML-RPC &lt;base64&gt; XML element, the contents of the element
are the base64 encoding of a byte string.  So you can use these functions
to create and interpret an XML-RPC XML stream.  You don't need these
functions if you use the higher level Xmlrpc-c facilities, because they
take care of the encoding and decoding of XML for you.  Even if you
use the <a href="#xmlencode">XML Encoding And Decoding</a> functions,
the library takes care of it.  You need these functions for XML-RPC only
if you're assembling your own XML character by character.

<p><b>xmlrpc_base64_encode()</b> encodes a string of bytes into base64.

<p><b>xmlrpc_base64_encode_without_newlines()</b> does the same, but
encodes it as a single line.  Base64 allows the characters to be
spread over lines any way you like -- the line breaks are meaningless.
<b>xmlrpc_base64_encode()</b> uses short lines to make the code easy
to display.  But some things that look at base64 codes, such as HTTP
authentication, do not understand that newlines are meaningless, so
you may need to use <b>xmlrpc_base64_encode_without_newlines()</b> to
make sure the only one is at the very end.

<p><b>xmlrpc_base64_decode()</b> decodes a string of bytes from base64.

<h2 id="charactercode">Character Code Conversions</h2>

<p>These functions deal with the various ways of representing characters and
text strings in a program.
See <a href="libgeneral.html#characterencoding">Character Encoding</a>.

<p>Like XML-RPC, Xmlrpc-c services mostly expect strings in UTF-8 form.
Note that all ASCII strings are also UTF-8.  A UTF-8 string in which no
byte has the high bit on is an ASCII string.

<p>Assuming the underlying platform has &quot;wide&quot; character string
services, Xmlrpc-c can alternatively deal with UCS-2 strings represented
with the <b>wchar_t</b> data type.

<p>Note that ANSI C does not precisely define the representation used
by <b>wchar_t</b>.  Xmlrpc-c always uses UCS-2, but your program may
expect UTF-16, UCS-4, or just about anything else.  If so, you won't
be able to use these conversion subroutines.

<h3 id="validate_utf8">xmlrpc_validate_utf8()</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_validate_utf8()</b> confirms that a text string
contains valid UTF-8 characters.  It fails if the string does not.
More precisely, it confirms that the text string contains valid UTF-8
characters of the Basic Multilingual Plane, which means they could
be represented as UCS-2.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
  <code>
    void 
    xmlrpc_validate_utf8(xmlrpc_env * envP,
                         const char * utf8_data,
                         size_t       utf8_len);
    </code>
  </pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is the handle of an <a href="#env">error environment
variable</a>.

<p><i>utf8_data</i> points to the bytes which form the alleged UTF-8
string; <i>utf8_len</i> is its length.


<h3 id="utf8_to_wcs">xmlrpc_utf8_to_wcs()</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_utf8_to_wcs()</b> converts a UTF-8 character string to a
UCS-2 &quot;wide&quot; character string (<b>wchar_t</b>).

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
  <code>
    xmlrpc_mem_block *
    xmlrpc_utf8_to_wcs(xmlrpc_env * envP,
                       const char * utf8_data,
                       size_t       utf8_len);
    </code>
  </pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is the handle of an <a href="#env">error environment
variable</a>.

<p><i>utf8_data</i> points to the bytes which form the UTF-8
string; <i>utf8_len</i> is its length.  If this is not valid UTF-8,
the function fails.

<p>The function returns a newly constructed <a href="#memoryblock">memory
block</a> which contains the bytes of the UCS-2 string.


<h3 id="wcs_to_utf8">xmlrpc_wcs_to_utf8()</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_wcs_to_utf8()</b> converts a UCS-2 &quot;wide&quot;
character string (<b>wchar_t</b>) to UTF-8.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
  <code>
    xmlrpc_mem_block *
    xmlrpc_wcs_to_utf8(xmlrpc_env *    const envP,
                       const wchar_t * const wcsData,
                       size_t          const wcsLen);
    </code>
  </pre>

<p><i>envP</i> is the handle of an <a href="#env">error environment
variable</a>.

<p><i>wcsData</i> points to the string of UCS-2 characters.  <i>wcsLen</i>
is its length in characters (i.e. the number of bytes it occupies is twice
<i>wcsLen</i>).


<h3 id="force_to_utf8">xmlrpc_force_to_utf8()</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_force_to_utf8()</b> is a weird but handy function.  It
examines the string you pass it to see if it is valid UTF-8, like
<b>xmlrpc_validate_utf8()</b>, but if it <em>isn't</em>, modifies it
until it is.  To do this, it 1) replaces some characters that have
the high bit on with DEL (0x3F) and 2) chops a few characters off the
end.

<p>This is useful because you may have some memory that is supposed to
contain a UTF-8 string but in reality contains garbage.  The supposed
string winds its way through XML-RPC to end up being viewed by a
human, and you'd like that human to see that it's garbage and deal
with it.  But the various Xmlrpc-c functions won't transport arbitrary
garbage; they transport only UTF-8.  The mutations that
<b>xmlrpc_validate_utf8()</b> makes are small enough that if it's only
partly garbage, then the non-garbage parts probably will make it all
the way through.

<p>Prototype:

<pre>
  <code>
    void
    xmlrpc_force_to_utf8(char * const buffer);
    </code>
  </pre>

<p><i>buffer</i> points to the quasi-UTF-8 string, which is terminated by a
zero byte (both as input and output).

<p>This function was new in Xmlrpc-c 1.12 (September 2007).


<h3 id="force_to_xml_chars">xmlrpc_force_to_xml_chars()</h3>

<p><b>xmlrpc_force_to_xml_chars()</b> is
similar to <b>xmlrpc_force_to_utf8()</b>.  It modifies a UTF-8 string to make
it contain nothing but valid XML characters.  All UTF-8 characters except
control characters are also XML characters, and CR, LF, and tab are
XML characters as well.  So this function simply replaces those 29
non-XML UTF-8 characters with DEL (the XML character with code point 0x3f).

<p>This isn't terribly useful, because of the Xmlrpc-c extension to
XML-RPC that allows a string to have non-XML characters in it.  But you
may not want to exploit that extension because your communication partner
doesn't have a similar extension.  In that case, you will have to make sure
you never create an XML-RPC string value that contains a non-XML character,
and <b>xmlrpc_force_to_xml_chars()</b> can help with that.
