<h1>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</h1>

<p>This chapter describes the functions in the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> function library, which is part of XML-RPC
For C/C++ (Xmlrpc-c).  Also see <a href="libgeneral.html">General
Library Information - C</a>

<p>The <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> library provides functions for use
in a program that is an XML-RPC server based on CGI (Common Gateway
Interface) scripts run by a web server.

<p>When using <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b>, you must also use the <a
href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b> library</a>.  It contains
additional facilities that an XML-RPC server needs but are general to
XML-RPC and not specific to XML-RPC servers.  Besides, the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> library routines depend on it.

<p>Similarly, you will need the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html">libxmlrpc_server</a> library.  It
contains functions for XML-RPC servers that are not specific to
CGI-based servers.  And <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> library
routines depend on it.

<p>There is a C++ equivalent of this library: <a
href="libxmlrpc_server_cgi++.html"><b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi++</b></a>.

<p>Before Xmlrpc-c 1.03 (June 2005), the library was called
<b>libxmlrpc_cgi</b>.  The name was changed for consistency with
other components.

<h2 id="header">Interface Header File</h2>

<p>The <B>&lt;xmlrpc-c/xmlrpc_server_cgi.h&gt;</B> header file declares the
interface to <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b>.  

<p>You'll have to figure out where on your system this file lives and
how to make your compiler look there for it, or use
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.

<p>Because the <b>libxmlrpc</b> and <b>libxmlrpc_server</b> libraries
are prerequisites, you'll also need their header files
(<b>xmlrpc.h</b> and <b>xmlrpc_server.h</b>).


<h2 id="linking">Linking The Library</h2>

<p>The classic Unix name for the file containing the
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> library is
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi.a</b> or <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi.so</b>.
The classic linker option to cause the library to be linked into your
program is <tt>-l xmlrpc_server_cgi</tt>.  These are hints; you'll
have to modify this according to conventions of your particular
platform.  You'll also have to figure out where the library resides
and how to make your linker look there for it.  Or use 
<a href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a>.


<p>The following libraries are prerequisites of <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b>,
so you'll need to link them in too:

<ul>
<li>libxmlrpc_server
<li>libxmlrpc
<li>libxmlrpc_parse
<li>libxmlrpc_xmltok
<li>libxmlrpc_util
</ul>

And remember that some static linkers care about the order in which
you specify the libraries, with the prerequisite libraries having to
come <em>after</em> the prerequiring library.  <a
href="xmlrpc-c-config.html"><b>xmlrpc-c-config</b></a> is a good way
to make sure you link all the prerequisites in the right order.

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>

<p>For a complete example of an XML-RPC server program that uses
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b>, see <a
href="index.html#cgiexample">CGI Server Example</a>.

<h2 id="aboutcgi">About CGI</h2>

<p>CGI (Common Gateway Interface) is a standard for use in web servers.
It is a protocol for the web server to use in calling a user-supplied
program to perform the meat of an HTTP request.  Whereas a web server
executes a classic HTTP GET request by sending the contents of a file
named in the GET request, the web server can be configured instead to
run an arbitrary CGI program.  The program gets the data that came
with the GET request and generates the data to be sent back in response.
CGI also works with requests other than GET, including POST.

<p>Since XML-RPC is implemented over HTTP (and a web server is an HTTP
server), all you need for an XML-RPC server is a web server configured
to invoke a CGI program that knows how to execute an XML-RPC call.
<b>libxmlrpc_server</b>'s <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
provides all the logic you need to execute an XML-RPC call, so all you
have to do is hook that up to the CGI interface.
<b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> gives the facilities to make that
connection.

<p>It is common to call a CGI program a &quot;CGI script.&quot; The
term &quot;script&quot; doesn't really convey what it is, though.  A
script is a description of a simple procedure, normally one that a
human would typically perform.  The first scripts were written on
paper and followed by human operators.  Later, they were automated.
The languages for writing automatic scripts became more and more
capable and the scripts more and more complex until programs written
in the scripting language bore far more resemblence to what has always
been called a &quot;program&quot; than to what was originally called a
&quot;script.&quot; The distinction most people use today is that if a
program is written in a language whose roots are in scripting, it's a
script and otherwise, it's a program.

<p>CGI programs are usually written in a language whose roots are in
scripting, so they have come to be known as scripts.  But regardless
of what language you use to write a CGI program, &quot;program&quot;
is a more meaningful name for it than &quot;script.&quot;

<h2 id="howtosetup">How To Set Up A CGI-Based Server</h2>

<p>How you set up a CGI program is a characteristic of your web server,
and differs from one web server program to another.

<p>However, if you can make your web server serve simple HTML web
pages, it's usually an easy step from there to make it a CGI-based
XML-RPC server.  Just create a file whose name ends in
&quot;.cgi&quot; instead of &quot;.html&quot;.  That file should
contain a program (an executable) you created using
<b>libxmlrpc_cgi</b>.

<p>Note that when you create an XML-RPC server this way, its URL may
not be of the classic &quot;/RPC2&quot; form.  And that means simple
programs may not be able to use it, at least not without coaxing.  The
URL would have the same form as you would use to browse .html files in
the same place.  For example, if you put the CGI program in a personal
web directory, the URL might be
http://www.acme.com/~johndoe/sample_add.cgi.

<p>It's common for a web server to be configured with CGI disabled, for
security reasons.

<p>For Apache, you the CGI program must go in a directory that has
the &quot;ExecCGI&quot; option, which gives the user permission to
run CGI programs in the directory.  Specify that in the Apache
configuration file.

<p>You must configure the web server to recognize your URL as a CGI
program to run, as opposed to a plain document to fetch or one of
various other things.  Usually, you set that up by directory
(e.g. &quot;cgi-bin&quot;) or filename extension
(e.g. &quot;.cgi&quot;).  For Apache, you can use either a ScriptAlias
or AddHandler statement in the configuration file for this.


<h2 id="styles">Styles Of CGI Server Programs</h2>

<p>There are lots of ways you can build an XML-RPC server based on the
CGI interface to a web server.

<p>The most basic (but not easiest) is not to use any Xmlrpc-c
facilities at all.  Write your own CGI program which takes an XML
document from the web server, interprets it as an XML-RPC call, and
returns to the web server an XML response.

<p>The next step up in convenience would be to have your CGI program
use <a href="libxmlrpc.html#xmlencode">Xmlrpc-c's XML encoding and
decoding tools</a> to free you from having to know the XML-RPC
protocol, and other <a href="libxmlrpc.html"><b>libxmlrpc</b></a>
facilities to process the data easily.  (But if you're writing CGI
programs, you probably have other facilities available to do that).

<p>The next step up would be to use an Xmlrpc-c method registry.
Instead of writing your own CGI interface code, have your CGI program
call <b>xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call()</b>.  To tell this function
what methods to execute, you build a <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a> and
identify it in <b>xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call()</b>'s arguments.
Now you don't have to know the CGI interface.

<p>There is another style in which you don't build a method registry
separately, but rather use <b>libxmlrpc_server_cgi</b> facilities to
add individual methods to a server instance.  I don't recommend this
style.  It used to be (before Xmlrpc-c 1.03 - June 2005) the only one,
so continues to exist for backward compatibility, but I find it to be
more complex than the newer <b>xmlrpc_server_cgi()</b> style.


<h2 id="howto">How To Write A CGI Server Program</h2>

<p>This section describes how to write a CGI program that uses the
Xmlrpc-c method registry to implement XML-RPC server functions.

<h3 id="process_call">xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call(xmlrpc_registry * const registryP);

</code>
</pre>

<p>This function processes an HTTP request which is supposedly an
XML-RPC call.  It processes it as defined by the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#method_registry">method registry</a>
identified by <i>registryP</i>.

<p>The function gets all the information about the HTTP request and
returns its results using the global variables (e.g. Unix environment
variables) of the CGI interface.


<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
<code>
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/base.h&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/server.h&gt;
    #include &lt;xmlrpc-c/server_cgi.h&gt;

    xmlrpc_registry * registryP;
    xmlrpc_env env;

    xmlrpc_env_init(&amp;env);

    registryP = xmlrpc_registry_new(&amp;env);

    xmlrpc_registry_add_method(
        &amp;env, registryP, NULL, "sample.add", &amp;sample_add, NULL);

    xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call(registryP);

</code>
</pre>

<p>For a complete example, see the program
<b>xmlrpc_sample_add_server_cgi.c</b> in the examples directory of the
Xmlrpc-c source tree.


<h2 id="oldmethod">Old Internal Registry Facility</h2>


<p>Before Xmlrpc-c Version 1.03 (June 2005), the old style is the only
one available.

<p>The old facility is the same as the new one, except that the
method registry is in a global variable that you don't normally see
and you build it using special functions that operate on that global
variable.

<p>This old facility is deprecated because it complicates programming
and understanding by using global variables and duplicating function
of <b>libxmlrpc_server</b>.


<h3 id="init">xmlrpc_cgi_init()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_cgi_init(int flags);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This sets up the internal method registry.  

<p><i>flags</i> must be zero.


<h3 id="cleanup">xmlrpc_cgi_cleanup()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_cgi_cleanup(void);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This cleans up the method registry created by
<b>xmlrpc_cgi_init()</b>.  Call it after you're done with it
(i.e. after you've called <b>xmlrpc_cgi_process_call()</b>


<h3 id="add_method">xmlrpc_cgi_add_method()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_cgi_add_method(char         * method_name,
		      xmlrpc_method  method,
		      void *         user_data);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This adds a method to the internal method registry.  It is
analogous to <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#addmethod"><b>xmlrpc_add_method()</b></a>.

<h3 id="add_method_w_doc">xmlrpc_cgi_add_method_w_doc()</h3>
<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_cgi_add_method_w_doc(char *method_name,
                            xmlrpc_method method,
                            void *user_data,
                            char *signature,
			    char *help);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This adds a method to the internal method registry.  It is
analogous to <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#addmethod"><b>xmlrpc_add_method_w_doc()</b></a>.


<h3 id="process_call_old">xmlrpc_cgi_process_call()</h3>
<pre>
<code>
void
xmlrpc_cgi_process_call(void);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This is the same thing as <a
href="#process_call"></a><b>xmlrpc_server_cgi_process_call()</b>
except that it uses the internal method registry.


<h3 id="registry">xmlrpc_cgi_registry()</h3>

<pre>
<code>
xmlrpc_registry *
xmlrpc_cgi_registry(void);
</code>
</pre>

<p>This gets you a pointer to the internal method registry.  (Which
means it isn't really internal, and there's even less reason to like
this old facility).


<h2 id="debugging">Debugging</h2>

<p>If you set the <a
href="libxmlrpc_server.html#trace_xml">XMLRPC_TRACE_XML</a>
environment variable to 1, the CGI program prints to Standard Error
the XML that it processes and returns.  This is not much more
informative than trace facilities that are probably available in your
web server.  But at least it will help you confirm that the CGI
program is running and you are using the method registry correctly.
