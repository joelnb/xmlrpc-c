This directory contains working examples of uses of XML-RPC-c.  There
are XML-RPC servers and XML-RPC clients that use the Xmlrpc-c libraries.

The simplest example is the 'query-meerkat' program, which contacts an
XML-RPC server that O'Reilly operates on the Internet called Meerkat.
Meerkat provides an RPC that returns a list of new articles that match
a specified search pattern.  Run 'query-meerkat' like this example:

  $ ./query-meerkat Linux

This responds with a list of new articles that contain the work "Linux",
according to O'reilly's Meerkat service.


The simplest server program is 'xmlrpc_sample_add_server'.  This
implements a single XML-RPC method called 'sample.add'.  All it does is
add two numbers and return the sum.  You can run such a server like
this:

  $ ./xmlrpc_sample_add_server 8080

The server this runs is based on the Abyss HTTP server.  file.  The
argument tell it to listen on TCP Port 8080 for RPCs.  It puts log
information in /tmp, so be sure to look there.

A client program that goes along with this server is
'xmlrpc_sample_add_client'.  All this client does is make an XML-RPC
request to Port 8080 of 'localhost' to add the numbers 5 and 7 and
print the result on Standard Output.

You can run such a client like this:

  $ ./xmlrpc_sample_add_client
