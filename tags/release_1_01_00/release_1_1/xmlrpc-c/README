This is the source code for XML-RPC for C/C++, or Xmlrpc-c for short.

XML-RPC for C/C++ is programming libraries and related tools to help you
write an XML-RPC server or client in C or C++.

Documentation for the package is at

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/doc

See the Xmlrpc-c website at:

PREREQUISITES
-------------

To build a useful XML-RPC client library, you'll need to have at least
one HTTP library.  The standard configuration uses the W3C Libwww library
(Version 5.3.2 or newer).  You can also configure the build to use
Curl or Wininet.

There are some old instructions on getting W3C Libwww in the file
GETTING_LIBWWW.  I haven't checked them recently, so I don't know how
valid they are.

The libraries need an XML parser/builder library.  An old version of
Expat is included in the package and used by default, so there's no
actual prerequisite here.  But if you separately obtain Libxml2, you can
configure the build to use that instead.  There's no really pressing
reason to do that, though.

Once that's done, you can type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make install

(There's supposed to be a 'make check' step in there too, to validate
that everything built OK, but it's broken right now - 2005.01.07).

You may want to pass a '--prefix' argument to configure. See './configure
--help' for details.

To see it work, start a simple server like this:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_server examples/abyss.conf

Then run a client that does an RPC to this server:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_client

Also try other sample servers and clients, described in examples/README.



Funding for the project that created the original Xmlrpc-c was
provided in part by the good folks at First Peer, Inc., producers of
P2P applications.

Eric Kidd developed the original Xmlrpc-c and maintained it up through
January 2001.

Bryan Henderson took over as maintainer in October 2004.
