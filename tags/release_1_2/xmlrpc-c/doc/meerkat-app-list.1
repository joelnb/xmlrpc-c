.SH NAME
meerkat-app-list \- Find all the recent Meerkat news matching a regex
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B meerkat-app-list
[\fIhours\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
meerkat-app-list queries O'Reilly's Meerkat wire service (which was
inspired in part by UserLand's wire service) for recent Linux-related
software releases.  The results include Freshmeat and several other
web sites.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.I hours
The number of hours of listings to return, relative to the current
time.  Values much larger than 24 or 48 tend to be fairly useless,
because the Meerkat database expires news very quickly.
.SH BUGS
Thanks to a server change at the O'Reilly network, this program is
temporarily broken.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR http://www.oreillynet.com/meerkat/ ,
.BR query-meerkat (1),
.BR xmlrpc\-c (7).
.PP
This program is part of xmlrpc-c.
