xmlrpc-c requires w3c-libwww 5.3.2 or newer.

There are two ways to get w3c-libwww: use a precompiled RPM, or build it by
hand.


Getting Libwww From an RPM
--------------------------

If your Linux distribution already includes an up-to-date copy of
w3c-libwww, you're in luck. (As of this writing, the only RPM-based
distribution with a new enough version was the Mandrake cooker.)

You can also get a pre-built copy of of w3c-libwww from the xmlrpc-c
project page on SourceForge:

  http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=16847

This can be installed alongside your distribution's out-of-date version of
w3c-libwww.


Building Libwww by Hand
----------------------- 

You can download the newest version of w3c-libwww from the W3C consortium:

  http://www.w3c.org/Library/

To install your copy of w3c-libwww in a non-standard location, you can type:

  $ cd w3c-libwww-5.3.2/
  $ ./configure --prefix=/opt/xmlrpc_libwww --without-expat
  $ make
  $ make install

You'll also need to set up the PATH so configure can find libwww-config:

  $ PATH=/opt/xmlrpc_libwww/bin:$PATH


Troubleshooting
---------------

xmlrpc-c can be tricky to compile on non-Unix systems (especially CygWin).
If you encounter problems, you might want to try searching the
xmlrpc-c-devel archive:
