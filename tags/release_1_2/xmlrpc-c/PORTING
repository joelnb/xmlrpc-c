Miscellaneous portability notes.
---

We assume that vsnprintf is present, and works according to either
old-style C rules or the new C99 rules.

We use new-style ANSI C varargs.

We *abuse* our varargs in various odd ways. All this code is based on
Python 1.5.2, and so should run on any normal system.

We assume that it's safe to convert between int and size_t in several
places. This might not be true if you somehow allocated more than 2
gigabytes in certain XML-RPC data structures.
This is a bug, and we're trying to clean it up.

We use atoi and atof, and assume they do something reasonable.

We define xmlrpc_int32 and xmlrpc_bool to contain signed 32-bit integers
and boolean values, respectively.

We assume that XML_UNICODE is *NOT* defined when compling expat.
