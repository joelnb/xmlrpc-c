# Makefile.config is generated by 'configure' using Makefile.config.in
# as a template and information that 'configure' gathers from the build
# system and from user options.

# Makefile.config should someday replace most of the other files that
# 'configure' generates, thus simplifying development and customization.
# Makefile.config is intended to contain information specific to the
# particular build environment or user build choices.

# Furthermore, most of the logic in 'configure', and thus 'configure.in',
# should go into the make files to simplify the build.  Makefile.config
# should just pass raw configure variables through to the make file.

# Tokens of the form @TOKEN@ in the template file get replaced by
# 'configure' with the values of variables of the same name within
# 'configure', because of a AC_SUBST(TOKEN) statement in the
# 'configure.in' from which 'configure' was built.

# Here are the options the user chose on 'configure':
