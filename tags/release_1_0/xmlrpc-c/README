WARNING: I've received several reports of potential security problems with
Abyss, but nothing specific and replicable.  Please see SECURITY for
details, and use a CGI-based server if at all possible.

---

This is a development release of an XML-RPC library for C and C++
programmers. As such, it still has a few rough edges.

This library has been released under an extremely generous license, but it
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY. Please see the file COPYING for the
appropriate terms and disclaimers.

You can find the official xmlrpc-c website at:

  http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/

To build this library, you'll need to have w3c-libwww 5.2.8 or newer.
Please see the following file:

  GETTING_LIBWWW        How to get a copy of w3c-libwww

Once that's done, you can type:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install

You may want to pass a '--prefix' argument to configure. See './configure
--help' for details.

To see it work, start a simple server like this:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_server examples/abyss.conf

Then run a client that does an RPC to this server:

  $ examples/xmlrpc_sample_add_client

Also try other sample servers and clients, described in examples/README.


To get started, have a look at the following files:

Funding for the project that created the original Xmlrpc-c was
provided in part by the good folks at First Peer, Inc., producers of
P2P applications.

Eric Kidd developed the original Xmlrpc-c and maintained it up through
January 2001.
