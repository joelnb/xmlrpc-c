This program generates C++ wrapper classes for XML-RPC servers.  It talks
to xmlrpc-c and XML-RPC.NET servers without any problems, but tends to
choke when talking to mod_php-based servers.  It looks like there is some
kind of pipelining problem.

This code is an ongoing project.  Please send feedback!
